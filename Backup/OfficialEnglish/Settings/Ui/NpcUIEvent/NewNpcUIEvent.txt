10001	Mysterious Cavern			The increasingly frequent earthquakes in your sect suddenly stopped recently, and at the same time, a mysterious cavern appeared in the ground. You can sense a strong but obscure will of a being from within the cave. You have no idea what it might be. \n Ancient cultivators are starting to appear in this realm more often. Maybe you can ask them for information.

10006	Natural Disaster			The mysterious being within the cavern was very angry, and brought about a disaster: [TXT].
10007	Disaster of Beasts			The mysterious being within the cavern was very angry, and it attracted a few monsters to attack your sect.
10008	Disaster of Destruction			The mysterious being within the cavern was very angry, and it spurted out a gush of water that broke through the surface of the ground.
10009	Out of Ashes			The enraged dragon broke through the ground and emerged.
10010	Slain			After a long and difficult fight, the Dragon was finally slain.
10011	Extreme Heat			For unknown reasons, the average temperature in this realm suddenly increased quite a bit. This rise in temperature has been far beyond normal changes in weather. It might indicate something unusual.
10012	Unhinged Monster			The extreme drought has driven monsters mad, and a couple of unhinged monsters have shown up near the sect.
10013	Blazing Wing Falling			A wave of heat swept across the sky, and something strange fell down.
10014	Prolonged Drought			The continuing heat has brought along a drought. You felt that the temperature was rising higher and higher. If you don't take action now, the situation might worsen.
10015	Unhinged Beast			A few monsters went crazy out of fear, and they even left their own territory so as to wreak havoc all over!
10016	Blazing Wing Falling			A wave of heat swept across the sky, and something strange fell down.
10017	Shrilling Sound			After casting a spell to drive away the prolonged drought, you found that the world seemed to become eerily quiet for an hour. A few moments later, a large flock of birds suddenly flew up from some remote mountains. A shrill and sinister sound broke the silence.
10018	Phoenoxica Arrives			A ferocious Phoenix draws near.
10019	Phoenoxica Falls			After a long and difficult fight, the Phoenix was finally slain.
10020	Polar Night Begins			For unknown reasons, the realm suddenly lost its balance of Yin and Yang. The area around your sect becomes enveloped in a pitch black, as if it were nighttime.
10021	Egg of Yin			A few strange eggs suddenly appeared near your sect in the middle of the night. There is something hatching inside them...
10022	Polar Day Begins			For unknown reasons, the realm suddenly lost its balance of Yin and Yang. It suddenly became high noon in the area around your sect... You don't know how long this chaos will continue.
10023	Egg of Yang			A few strange eggs suddenly appeared near your sect in the middle of the day. There is something hatching inside them...
10024	Torch Dragon's Chaos			The continued chaos of Yin and Yang finally reached its limit. With a drawn-out sigh, a giant creature began to manifest within the realm!
10025	Egg Hatching			As the strange eggs began to hatch, the Yin and Yang of the realm slowly lost balance!
10026	Egg Breaking			As the strange eggs were destroyed, the Yin and Yang of this realm slowly lost balance!
10027	Drastic Change			There was a sudden burst of Qi in the Central Plains. At first, no one paid much attention to it, thinking that it was another normal change in the flow of Qi. As time goes by, people started to realize that the scale and intensity of the burst was beyond all expectations. It has been spreading from the epicenter for more than a month, proving that ultimately it was a drastic change that would affect all cultivators.\n Now, the influence of the burst has reached your sect. As everyone enjoys the overflowing Qi, you wonder what this drastic change could mean for all of you...
10028	Thousand-year Tide			It has been days since the burst of Qi finished spreading across the realm. From reading old documents, the famous sects eventually decided that it was the tide of Qi that surges every 3,000 years. Ancient cultivators that were in slumber for various reasons started to be revived one by one by the Thousand-year Tide.\n Without the current order and rules, cultivators in ancient times believed in the law of the jungle. These cultivators with ancient beliefs and significant experience in cultivation has caused chaos in the world of cultivators in just a few days' time...
10029	Disaster in the Wild South			A mysterious disaster happened recently on the mountains of the northern borderland. It was said that the ground and mountains shook for a minute, and the sound was so loud that it spread across thousands of miles. When the nearby cultivators arrived, they only found all the mountains drowned in water, with strong ominous Qi permeating the area.\n It seems that a few rare and elusive ancient beasts that hide in the mountains and lakes are affected by the Thousand-year Tide and have become active again.
10030	Underground Noise			The Thousand-year Tide has passed. In a little more than a month, ancient cultivators were revived, and ancient beasts started to become active again... The world of cultivators was faced with drastic change. As time goes by, the world of cultivators has gradually regained its peace and balance. Everything seems to be back on track. \n However, underground quakes started to happen frequently in your sect. You don't know what is going on...
10031	Tribulation of Dragons			The power of the Heavenly Tribulation has killed all the unborn Flood Dragons...
10032	Threatening			The mysterious cavern suddenly became menacing, and it wanted you to [TXT].
