2	While travelling around the world of immortals, [NAME] accidentally ate a strange item [DAN1]. Unexpectedly, this thing happened to be a peculiar being manifested from Chaos. After consuming it, [NAME]'s attainment increased dramatically to the point of uncontrollable. Eventually [NAME] achieved heavenly harmony and became one with the way of heaven.
3	While travelling around in the world of immortals, [NAME] accidentally learned of the profoundness of Golden Immortal of Great Principle. Although the immortals are all free and unfettered, they have different levels of achievements, hence different magnitude of powers. Only those who reached complete attainment in the mortal realm are able to achieve the Great Principle and made creations beyond the Chaos. Yearning for this, [NAME] re-entered the cycle of reincarnation resolutely in order to achieve the Great Principle some day.
4	Having been cultivating quietly for many years, [NAME] finally managed to reach the threshold into State of Heavenly Immortal. However, due to an inadequacy of mental state cultivation, [NAME] became lost while trying to break through the State of Reincarnation, losing all immortal cultivation and fell back into the cycle of reincarnation.
5	[NAME] decided to settle down after having traveled around in the world of immortals for many years. After finding a nice spot at [PLACE1], the immortal started to live in seclusion, away from any disturbance and not to be seen ever again.
6	[NAME] got involved with multiple conflicts among immortals while travelling. Unable to let go of such karmic entanglements, [NAME] eventually had an immortal mental breakdown during a closed-door cultivation session, causing both body and spirit to disperse, thus reentering the cycle of reincarnation.
7	In the war between the immortal world and the demons, [NAME] was unfortunately infested with demonic breath. By the time it was discovered, nothing could be done about it anymore. To avoid the fate of completely transforming into a demonic being, [NAME] had no choice but to give up all cultivation and re-entered the cycle of reincarnation.
8	While travelling at [PLACE1], [NAME] discovered an anomaly called [EVENT1]. To better comprehend its mystery, [NAME] decided to build a Cave Mansion in the nearby void to settle down.\n...During one meditation session, a mutated outbreak suddenly erupted from the anomaly. Unprepared for such calamity, [NAME]'s mind and power was snatched away and become forever lost to the phenomenon. There is no traces ever since.
9	Having been cultivating quietly for many years, [NAME] finally managed to reach the threshold into State of Heavenly Immortal. However, due to a lack of magical training, [NAME] failed in the process of remolding a body of Anasrava, despite having gone through the State of Reincarnation. Unwilling to live indefinitely as a spirit immortal, [NAME] decided to dissolve its own cultivation and re-entered the cycle of reincarnation.
10	While travelling around the world of immortals, [NAME] accidentally knocked [NAME1]'s inner disciple down to the mortal realm. To break the chains of causality, [NAME1] personally obliterated the cultivation of [NAME], sending it back into the cycle of reincarnation.
11	While travelling around the world of immortals, [NAME] encountered the outbreak of a demonic rift at [PLACE1]. To prevent a large-scale demonic infestation from happening, many immortals worked together to lock this place down and have been fighting the demons for decades. Unfortunately, [NAME] had fallen in this war and re-entered the cycle of reincarnation.
12	While travelling at [PLACE1], [NAME] was surrounded and attacked by [MONSTER1] and got immortal body obliterated. [NAME] had no choice but to dissolve own power and re-entered the cycle of reincarnation.
13	While travelling around in the world of immortals, [NAME] had a suddenly inspiration of [IDEA1] and comprehended the way of heavenly immortal. [NAME] then cultivated behind closed doors for more than ten years at [PLACE1], finally achieving the State of Heavenly Immortal after remolding a Body of Anasrava and seeing through a hundred reincarnations.\n...Within the State of Reincarnation, a thousand years is but a blink of an eye. Looking back, all that happened in the past have become irrelevant as if some distant mist. It was at this moment [NAME] finally understood what it means to be in a State of Heavenly Immortal, and why those ascending masters of the past never returned to the Mortal Realm.
14	While travelling at [PLACE1], [NAME] was surrounded and attacked by [MONSTER1]. Although managed to escape, [NAME]'s immortal body was obliterated and almost had to re-enter the cycle of reincarnation. In desperation, [NAME] forcibly broke through the State of Heavenly Immortal, enabling Primordial Spirit to enter the State of Reincarnation, dissolving own physical body and magical power in the process. A hundred reincarnations passed within the blink of an eye. Favored by fortune, what's remaining of [NAME]'s spirit managed to persevere, and it successfully broke out of the State!\nAt the moment of awakening, [NAME]'s power has been tempered into that of the Celestials, and body remolded into that of Anasrava. Looking back, all that happened in the past have become irrelevant as if some distant mist. It was at this moment [NAME] finally understood what it means to be in a State of Heavenly Immortal, and why those ascending masters of the past never returned to the Mortal Realm.
15	[NAME] encountered [NAME1] giving a lecture of [IDEA1] at [PLACE1]. Indulging in these profound words, [NAME] suddenly felt a quiver in Primordial Spirit, and fell straight into the State of Reincarnation. Luckily, [NAME] tapped the key to achieving a Breakthrough to the State of Heavenly Immortal then and there.\nOne does not perceive the passage of time in the State of Reincarnation. By the time [NAME] came around, several sixty-year cycles have already passed. [NAME]'s power has been tempered into that of the Celestials, and body remolded into that of Anasrava. Looking back, all that happened in the past have become irrelevant as if some distant mist. It was at this moment [NAME] finally understood what it means to be in a State of Heavenly Immortal, and why those ascending masters of the past never returned to the Mortal Realm.
16	[NAME] found [DAN1] by chance at [PLACE1]. After consuming it, [NAME] made a huge progress in cultivation, tapping the key to achieving a Breakthrough to the State of Heavenly Immortal. Due to the movement of Qi, [NAME]'s Primordial Spirit had helplessly fallen into the State of Reincarnation.\nWithin the State of Reincarnation, a thousand years is but a blink of an eye. Going through a hundred reincarnations of hardships, [NAME] preserved a wisp of spirit from dying out and managed to break out of the State, forging an immortal Body of Anasrava. Looking back again, [NAME] felt events of the past have become irrelevant as if some distant mist, just like those experiences in the many reincarnations. It was at this moment [NAME] finally understood what it means to be in a State of Heavenly Immortal, and why those ascending masters of the past never returned to the Mortal Realm.
17	[NAME] had a sudden revelation at [PLACE1]. Deeming it a profoundly connected location through fate, [NAME] built a Cave Mansion in the nearby void as a dojo. In the following hundred years, [NAME] collected a variety of spirit beasts and immortal children inside the Cave Mansion, where a handful of immortal friends would also gather together every now and then to discuss magical matters. Gradually, the place has become quite an attraction.
18	While travelling at [PLACE1], [NAME] unexpectedly discovered an anomaly called [EVENT1]. To better comprehend its mystery, [NAME] decided to build a Cave Mansion in the nearby void to settle down.\nTo immortals, a hundred years is but a blink of an eye regardless of their age. As time gone by, other immortals started to gather together here in seek of inspiration on [EVENT1]. Due to its location, [NAME]'s Cave Mansion gradually became a place of interest where people would exchange ideas and discuss the phenomenon. It has become quite an attraction.
19	While travelling at [PLACE1], [NAME] entered the lair of [MONSTER1] by mistake. In the desperate moment, a few fellow immortals passing by came to the rescue, enabling [NAME] to escape with a Manifestation. After this battle, [NAME] and the helping immortals became close friends with each other. Together they decided to build a Cave Mansion at that place, which can be used as a place of meditation as well as a sign of notice, warning other immortals to not disturb the sleeping [MONSTER1] and put themselves in danger.\nMore than a hundred years have passed. Grateful for the immortals' ward, the [MONSTER1] even formed an alliance with [NAME]. With the help of the [MONSTER1]'s power, [NAME]'s Cave Mansion was developed even further, becoming a Sanctum of Paradise.
20	While travelling at [PLACE1], [NAME] encountered an immortal friend of the opposite gender. Getting along very well, the two of them joined hands and started to travel together. As it turned out, the two were destined lovers through a hundred reincarnations. Now that they have both broken through the State of Reincarnation and met again in the world of immortals, it was truly a sign from above.\nAfter spending several years together, their past memories gradually revived. They became partners again, built a Cave Mansion at the location where they first met and developed the place for a hundred years. Their story became quite a tale.
21	While travelling around in the world of immortals, [NAME] got on good terms with [NAME1] by chance, and decided to serve under [NAME1]'s school of creed for renown and shelter. [NAME1] is one of the oldest Golden Immortal of Great Principle in the Nine Upper Heavenly Realms, the dojo of whom is located within the Chaos in the Heaven Beyond Heavens. That place is a world all by itself, dominating the Nine Upper Heavenly Realms.
22	While travelling around in the world of immortals, [NAME] was touched by all the sufferings caused by the infestation of demons, and decided to find a position at the Celestial Court. The Celestial Court is the power that represents the Nine Upper Heavenly Realms. It anoints all the different immortals to perform their duties and is responsible for maintaining the ways of heaven. It is also the main force in the fight against demonic infestation.
23	While travelling around in the world of immortals, [NAME] felt deeply that the way of immortals is eternal and boundless, and wished to cultivate even further in seek of higher attainment. [NAME] then traveled beyond the Trayastrimsa Heavens to learn from the Ancestral Master of Tao.
24	While travelling around in the world of immortals, [NAME] came across another ascending cultivator from the same realm by chance. After some exchanges of information, [NAME] learned that cultivators from their original realm even formed an alliance in the Nine Upper Heavenly Realms to support each other. Having experienced extensive hardships in the ways of immortal, [NAME] agreed to join the alliance.
25	Suddenly a thought surfaced in [NAME]'s mind, "I worked for a lifetime to achieve immortality. If I were not to ascend further and reach the State of Great Principle, wouldn't I be a fool who have given up a life of freedom and happiness for nothing?" Thus was [NAME]'s ambition for Great Principle born.
26	Having suddenly come to the realization that the world of immortals is not a realm of eternal freedom and happiness neither - as conflicts, manipulations and the likes of demonic infestations occur in here as well - [NAME] became bored with all of this. [NAME] secretly decided to escape from the chains of causality, in order to achieve true freedom eventually.
27	[NAME] suddenly felt that there are so many secrets and wonders between heaven and earth. Instead of being entangled in the endless disputes generated by different causes and effects, it is a far more pleasant life to just go explore all the mysteries. Thus was [NAME]'s desire for explorations born.
28	[NAME] suddenly thought about how good it must feel for the immortals of Great Principle to rule over the world beneath them with great prestige and authority. How enjoyable would that be, to gather powerful friends in the world of immortals and rule a local realm. It is only fitting that someone with great cultivation would achieve such dominance. Thus was [NAME]'s ambition for dominance born.
29	[NAME] ran into an immortal whose mind was infested with demon at [PLACE1]. After a fierce fight, [NAME] emerged victorious and executed the demon.
30	[NAME] suddenly had a great comprehension of [IDEA1] at [PLACE1], so far as inventing a brand new Miracle out of it, and making a significant progress in cultivation.
31	While travelling around in the world of immortals, [NAME] bumped into [NAME1] while the latter was performing miracle to build a Cave Mansion within Chaos to help the newer generation. [NAME] was deeply fascinated, seeing earth, water, fire and wind surging and boiling to rearrange themselves as [NAME1] commanded the natural elements with arms and feet.
32	Having been inspired by observation of [EVENT1] at [PLACE1], [NAME] inadvertently sank into a Meditated State. When finally woke up, several years of time have passed and [NAME] had made a huge progress in attainment.
33	[NAME] found a baby [MONSTER1] by chance. It was a great opportunity. It is worthy of note that [MONSTER1] is a miraculous beast of heaven and earth, with magical power strong enough to rival that of the Golden Immortals of Great Principle once they grow into adults. If one is to be raised from a young age, it will most definitely be a tremendous help.
34	While travelling around in the world of immortals, [NAME] encountered a fellow individual cultivator from the same realm who ascended hundreds of years ago. The two talked and drank with each other extensively, neglecting the passage of time which have been more than ten years.
35	While travelling around in the world of immortals, [NAME] came across [NAME1] exchanging views with other people on philosophical matters, which lasted more than ten years eventually. Having listened to the entire discussion, [NAME] gained great inspirations from it.
36	While travelling around in the world of immortals, [NAME] incidentally found a [DAN1] at [PLACE1]. Refining it with body and spirit, [NAME] thoroughly comprehended its profoundness and made a great progress in attainment.
37	While travelling around in the world of immortals, [NAME] encountered a little Heavenly Abode. After some exploration, [NAME] found that this was the final resting place of a heavenly immortal that lived thousands of years ago, and had long been abandoned. As of who and where this immortal is, no one knows. Sighing with mixed feelings, [NAME] collected a good deal of immortal treasures from it before leaving.
38	While travelling around in the world of immortals, [NAME] suddenly felt a strong spiritual connection, hence split out a Manifestation down the Mortal Realm to direct a young disciple, who is the connected one, to re-enter the way of immortals.

41	While travelling around in the world of immortals, [NAME] ran into a fellow immortal at [PLACE1]. For some reason, they found each other very easy to get along with. The two of them talked for a long time and even set up a game of chess. Immortals do not perceive the passage of time like common people. By the time the game ends, a thousand years have passed.

47	[NAME] came across a fellow immortal at [PLACE1]. They got along very well, and found their views on the way of cultivation very agreeable. To confirm their mutual harmony, [NAME] and the immortal friend set them a hundred-year-long duel of magic. The two of them each performed great Miracles, complementing and learning from each other. They both made some incredible comprehensions. Not only the two of them, but also the surrounding audience who have watched the duel throughout a hundred years have gained insights from it. The story has become quite a tale.
48	For some reason, [NAME] suddenly felt like crafting an immortal artifact. However, due to lack of Tao Buildup at the last minute, the artifact failed to produce. Disappointed, [NAME] casually gave out the failed treasure to young disciples in Mortal Realm.
49	While travelling around the world of immortals, [NAME] encountered the outbreak of a demonic rift at [PLACE1]. To prevent a large-scale demonic infestation from happening, many immortals worked together to lock this place down and have been fighting the demons for decades. Having experienced this bloody battle, [NAME] became blessed by the Creed of Heaven, greatly increasing attainment.
50	[NAME] felt lost after being expelled from the school. Fortunately, every skill and piece of knowledge that have been learned still stands. Let's sort out our mood and head back into the world of mortals.
51	[NAME] was ambushed by archenemy at [PLACE2]. Unprepared for such treachery, [NAME] eventually fell in battle despite having fought back valiantly in every way possible. A lifetime of cultivation is thus forever lost.
52	After many years of painstaking cultivation, [NAME] finally carried out the final step and survived Heavenly Tribulation at [PLACE2], ascending from this world and becoming an immortal.

55	[NAME] accidentally entered the Cave Mansion of an Ancient Cultivator at [PLACE2]. However, due to some severe misfortune, [NAME] fell into a Prohibition Ward and had been unable to escape.

It was appallingly horrible.
61	Overcome with greed, [NAME] sneaked into the treasury of [SCHOOL2] to steal, but ended up getting caught.

It was a sad end indeed.

64	[NAME] spent many years in the world of cultivators and found the competition in the Central Plains too severe to make a living. Therefore, [NAME] shapeshifted into a southern barbarian and started a new career in the Wild South, recruiting a group of natives and collecting a variety of rare materials and treasures. They became a quite powerful faction in the local region.
65	Having been severely injured in a fight, [NAME] was seduced by the Celestial Demon at the brink of death, and started practicing Incarnation of Celestial Demon, thus becoming a demon follower.

As it turned out, this place was part of the mechanism specially designed for the ancient immortal's legacy of teachings. While feeling resentful, one had no choice but to rebuild magical power from scratch. [NAME] kept cultivating for several years before going free again.
