			<DisplayName>Fallen Obliteration Body</DisplayName>
			<Desc>In the past, some physical cultivators thought of this life as a cage and polar nights are the light cast from outside the cage. They absorbed a strange essence from the polar nights and used it to remold the body, believing it will eventually be transformed into a vehicle that breaks the cage and carries them away from the misery. This school of physical cultivators worshiped polar nights and were shunned by everyone else, thus named Obliteration Cult. Their foundational Law is therefore called Obliteration Body.</Desc>
			<SelectDesc>Physical training means combining energy, Qi and spirit into one, cutting out Qi and any other magical items and beginning practice with only the physical body. Do you want to take this Law?</SelectDesc>
