			<DisplayName>Eight Heavens Sadhana</DisplayName>
			<Desc>A Law of Shendao cultivation method that had been lost since ancient times, it is a way of gathering the Belief of living beings in order to achieve divinity. Most schools of Law of Shendao share a lot of similarities, they only differ in the kind of spiritual catalyst being used, which summon different celestial beings for protection. The heritage of Eight Heavens Sadhana came from the heaven beyond heavens to the west. By cultivating this method, one would be able to harness the spiritual catalyst of many heavens to summon the Eight Legion spirits as guardians. It emphasizes spellcraft.</Desc>
