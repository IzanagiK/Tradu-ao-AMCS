			<Desc>A Law of Shendao cultivation method that had been lost since ancient times, it is a way of gathering the faith of living beings in order to achieve divinity. Most schools of Law of Shendao share a lot of similarities, they only differ in the kind of spiritual catalyst being used, which summon different celestial beings for protection. Nether Salvation Sutra is the heritage of Specter Master. By cultivating this method, one would be able to harness the spiritual catalyst of the nine Netherworlds to summon the Nether spirits as guardians. It emphasizes on the ways of Protection.</Desc>
