10122	Ascension	[NAME] has gone through all the hardships and finally embraced oblivion with mortal body, ascending above this realm and leaving nothing but legends to be told for future generations.\nA poem as evidence:\n[color=#D06508]Out of the sorted chaos of the universe, the first ever human being was born. The oneness came before duality, and the Four Symbols guarded the earth.\nThe goddess gave life to all creations from clay, while the Great Bright One drew the picture that divided Yin and Yang.\nA hundred years of cultivation passed by while soldiers fought in countless battles. Another thousand years are only a blink of an eye in meditation.\nI shall say no more as the Heavenly Tribulation comes to take me away. All the worldly problems will be gone with the wind after I leave this plane of existence.[/color]	SeeGod
