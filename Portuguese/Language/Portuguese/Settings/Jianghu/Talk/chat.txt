Elder [color=#ff0000]Xie Si[/color] immediately gave up the artifact that was almost completed, and prepared to follow the sect leader's order, proving his loyalty to the sect.

Chat_Place_JiuHua	0	[HENAME], anything to talk about in your sect?	[color=#ff0000]Qin Jie[/color] is such an unlucky kid. He spent decades preparing for the Core Shaping, and when the time is ripe in [desc_daytime=-20], he asked for his master to guard him. His request was ignored by his master, who instead took part in some closed-door session and injured himself internally while meditating, decades' preparation going down the drain. What a shame.

Chat_Place_BirthPlace14	1	Anything interesting happened here?	There are so many well known great sharp tools that exist, though you never hear about the blunt ones. Sharp and blunt tools have different uses though, so... We all use sharp ones, but there are said to be some blunt ones used in mining jade, thought I know not where they might be.						
Chat_Place_JiuHua1	1	Anything interesting happened here?	I saw an entertainer before that had all types of beasts with him. They lined themselves up by themselves.

Chat_Place_FertileField3	1	Anything interesting happened here?	I've been to the Great Desert before for business. There's a village there where the people only eat raw meat... They don't know a thing about Flour!						
Chat_Place_CentralPlains4	1	Anything interesting happened here?	Someone in the village ate some mushrooms brought from outside the village a few days ago...he was out for 3 days. While out, he was sweating profusely or giggling in his sleep. When he awoke, he told us he had seen everyone in town turn into birds in a dream. We thought he went crazy, but he returned to normal later on.						
Chat_Place_CentralPlains5	1	Anything interesting happened here?	I once bought some mushrooms for very cheap, which I ate when I got back home. I soon realized that there were flowers on the wall, which I began to pick. I don't know how many days later, I realized that people were looking at me in a funny manner, it seems I had been digging at the wall...						
Chat_Place_BirthPlace11	1	Anything interesting happened here?	Riverbank Plains produces quite a bit of Flour. Our ancestors produces more Wheat than them, though we were never able to produce half as much Flour and it's not known why.						
Chat_Place_BirthPlace13	1	Anything interesting happened here?	A lot of our Cotton is sold to Reed Village. They're incredibly fast at sewing and the women there wear some sort of bracer.

Chat	2	[HENAME], anything interesting lately?	It's upsetting, but that day, I fought and only used half of what I know, yet I was accused of stealing secret techniques from the west. I'm really quite upset... Swordsmanship is nothing more than those patterns... You don't distinguish between the changes that follow, how can you come to any real conclusion?						
Chat	2	[HENAME], anything interesting lately?	Recently, the others urge me to hurry up and break through to a new State. How can you hurry such a thing? I can only tell them I'm almost there... How vexing.						
Chat	2	[HENAME], anything interesting lately?	I've come to a realization recently: The Creed of Practice, it's not good or bad, it's just something that can't be mastered completely. The Creed, in the end, lies within. To be worthy of one's own heart is enough.						
Chat	2	[HENAME], anything interesting lately?	Speaking of talismans, we have to bring up Skydome Palace's elder [color=#ff0000]He Zudao[/color].					Npc_JiTian_1	Npc_JiTian_1
ZhuLongChat	0	Is it Torch Dragon, the manifestation of Yin and Yang of the Creed of Heaven? It seems a bit strange for it to suddenly descend here. What happened?	I am Torch Dragon. Some things from the Otherworld have flowed into this realm recently, along with the Creed of Heaven of the Otherworld. I have been affected by that and thus appeared in this form. Among these things, there is the Prayer Coin, which is the combination of the wishes of people from the Otherworld, quite intriguing. If you are willing to give it to me, I shall grant you a wish with my power from the Creed of Heaven.
