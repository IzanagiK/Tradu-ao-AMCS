[NAME]此次来极天宫，无意间看到极天宫一名刚入门的弟子正喃喃自语的阅读一本书册。[NAME]十分好奇，遂上前询问。那名弟子考虑到[NAME]的宗门也是名满天下的大派且与本派交好，于是便笑着解释了一番。	On this trip to the Skydome Palace, [NAME] inadvertently saw a new disciple muttering to himself while reading. [NAME]'s curiosity was piqued and decided to investigate further. The disciple considered that [NAME]'s school was an important sect and it did have a good relationship with this one, so thereupon [HE] smiled and explained things.
原来极天宫开派宗师开宗立派后便游历人间，最后下落不明。只有古代留下的孤本《群仙录》记载其最后游戏人间的传说故事。历代极天宫弟子无事之时都会翻阅此册，一方面瞻仰祖师，一方面也希望都在据此寻找开派宗师的遗蜕线索。	As it turns out, the master of the Skydome Palace decided to roam the realm after establishing the school, and where he ended up is not presently known. It is only in the single extant copy of "Record of the Immortals" that it has been recorded where exactly it is that his journeys took him. Disciples at the Skydome Palace have been reading this volume for generations, on one hand one can learn about revered masters, on the other it gives clues to those that hope to track down the founder.
[NAME]心中一动，便问这名弟子讨要了一份副本好回去研读。	[NAME] felt that trying to find clues as to the founder's whereabouts was of interest and asked if [IT] could make a copy, which [IT] would take back and investigate.
[NAME]拜访了[SCHOOL]，[SCHOOL]上下十分欢迎你的来访，他们盛情邀请[NAME]在此小住了几天，并带他游览了[SCHOOL]附近。在这些日子里，[NAME]与诸位同道切磋道法，谈天说地，十分尽兴。	[NAME] visited [SCHOOL], the [SCHOOL] welcomed [ENHIM] with open arms and asked [ENHIM] to stay a few days. While there, [IT] took a tour around [SCHOOL]. [NAME] learned from everyone over the course of just a few days about a great many things.
临走之时，[SCHOOL]送了[NAME]一份珍贵的礼物，希望两派的友谊可以长存。	When it came time to go, the [SCHOOL] presented [NAME] with a precious gift with the hope that the two sects could enjoy mutual friendship for years to come.
[NAME]拜访了[SCHOOL],[SCHOOL]派中的几个弟子奉命接待了[NAME]。双方愉快的谈了一个下午，[NAME]看看天色已晚，便告辞而去。	[NAME] visited [SCHOOL], some of the disciples of [SCHOOL] received[NAME], as ordered. Both parties had a riveting discussion that lasted until evening. [NAME] noticed that it was getting late, said [ITS] farewells and departed.
[NAME]拜访了[SCHOOL]，但[SCHOOL]的看门弟子表示派中有突发急事，不便待客。	[NAME] visited [SCHOOL], but the disciple at the gate of [SCHOOL] said that something urgent had come up and that it would not be a good time to receive guests.

在[NAME]走进密室后，才发现这是一个陷阱，他被[SCHOOL]抓住，成为了活靶子，几经折磨后，他假死闭气，被弃尸荒野，侥幸逃了出来。	Upon walking into the back room, [NAME] discovered that it was a trap. [IT] was grabbed by members of [SCHOOL] like a sitting duck. After being tortured for quite a while, [IT] faked [ITS] death, was left in the wilderness, and was able to make it out alive.
[NAME]潜入极天宫的藏宝库，竟然发现藏宝库最中心供奉有一本书册。	[NAME] snuck into the Skydome Palace's treasure room and discovered a volume at the heart of the room.
[NAME]心中一动，想到宗门在修行界收集到的一些极天宫的传言，于是将这本书册悄悄偷了出来。	Like lightning had struck, [NAME] remembered some of the rumors that [IT] had heard about the Skydome Palace, so [IT] decided to sneak out with the volume.
[NAME]偷偷潜入了[SCHOOL]，他几经周折，终于找到了[SCHOOL]的藏宝室，并从中偷拿了几件宝物。事后，[SCHOOL]以术法推算，从蛛丝马迹中得知偷盗者的身份，为此恼怒不已。	[NAME] snuck into [SCHOOL], and after a few twists and turns, found [ITS] way to their treasure room and made off with a few relics. After the fact, [SCHOOL] determined the identity of the thief and they were quite incensed.

[NAME]刻意收了神通，以凡人之身体会凡人之心，游戏人间，随心而为。某日清晨，[IT]心中忽然一动，竟然有所领悟。	[NAME] concealed [ITS] magic power on purpose and, with a mortal body and mind, [IT] roamed the realm doing as [IT] pleased. One morning, like lightning suddenly [IT] understood it all.

[IT] didn't care for morality and only based decisions on like or dislike: Riches and honor are doted upon the obedient, while life is taken from the disobedient.

The old woman said: "I am polishing needles, can't you see that?" [NAME] thought that this old woman must be getting on in the years and growing foggy between her ears. [IT] cast a spell and healed her enfeebling mind, then left on [ITS] artifact.
老太太惊呼神仙，对[NAME]感恩不已。	The old woman cried out in alarm at the immortals and expressed profuse thanks to [NAME].

[NAME]参考了异兽满是皱褶的皮肤，恍然大悟。这样的结构确实可以更好的消解攻击中的冲击力。	[NAME] ruminated upon the folds in beasts' hides and gained great insight. This type of structure is better suited for absorbing impacts.
[NAME]努力的观察模仿，但是始终学不到其中的那点神髓，总是差了点灵感。异兽争斗了一会，便各自离去了。	[NAME] put a lot of effort into observing and imitating, but could not come to understand the essence of it all. Insight always seemed just short of the goal. The beasts fought for a while, then they stalked off.
多次的围观异兽的警觉，两只异兽竟然一起向[NAME]发动了凌厉的攻击，[NAME]猝不及防，一番纠缠争斗之下，受了不少伤才得以脱身。	After observing animals alert multiple times, two beasts rushed at [NAME]. [NAME] was caught off guard and grappled with them, then escaped after taking more than a few injuries.

But, as everyone's combining of their powers was about to succeed, [NAME] suddenly tried to throw a number of the {0} disciples into the line of fire. \nBut as the {0} disciples weren't without their own skills, they had already harbored malintent, so as [NAME] went to make [ITS] move, they turned the formation on [ENHIM], hitting [ENHIM] for some heavy damage before [IT] could get out of the way and weakening [ENHIM] in the process.
[NAME]惊怒交加，御剑赶了过去，发现这是一群{0}的邪魔布下化血大阵收人生魂，修炼魔功。\n[NAME]眼见情况紧急，来不及多想，运起全身功力轰破阵眼。{0}的弟子受阵法反噬，纷纷受伤，勃然大怒。放出性命交修的法宝向[NAME]攻来。\n[NAME]含怒出手，毫不容情，不消的几个回合便将敌手尽数诛杀，拯救了这个城镇的凡人。	[NAME] was both surprised and angered. [IT] readied [ITS] sword then rushed over only to discover that this group of {0} demons was using blood transformation to suck in living souls just to practice their magic. \n[NAME] saw that the situation was in dire straits, but could not think of a solution, so [IT] put all of [ITS] force to bear to bombard the Auxiliary of the formation. The {0} disciples were hit by the formation that has gone haywire and were injured one after another, and they were enraged by it. They all turned their weapons on [NAME]. \n[NAME] threw all [ITS] rage and without holding back into attacking the enemy and wiped them all out, saving the people of the city.

[IT] readied [ITS] sword then rushed over only to discover that this group of {0} demons was using blood transformation to suck in living souls just to practice their magic. \n[NAME] saw that the situation was in dire straits, but could not think of a solution, so [IT] put all of [ITS] force to bear to bombard the Auxiliary of the formation. The {0} disciples were hit by the formation that has gone haywire and were injured one after another. Exploded with rage, they all turned their weapons on [NAME]. \nBoth sides fought ardently all day, [NAME]'s Qi was slowly being depleted and [IT] began to gripe. The enemy actually seemed to have seen through [NAME]'s predicament and broke through [ITS] Qi barrier. [NAME]'s blood was spurting out all over the place. [IT] managed to protect [ITS] main artery as [IT] fled.
[NAME]赶了过去，发现是{0}的内门弟子正在围剿一群邪派弟子。\n虽同为邪道，[NAME]却与{1}的这几名弟子早有私怨。他狞笑两声，毫无声息的向这帮{1}的弟子发动偷袭。由于毫无防备，[NAME]一招就重创对方数人\n双方本来势均力敌，[NAME]的偷袭使得{1}迅速溃败，[NAME]放开手脚，大杀特杀，将这群{1}的弟子全歼当场。不过[NAME]不欲与正道纠缠，搜了几个无主的宝物便迅速离去。	[NAME] rushed over and discovered that the {0} disciples had a group of a sect of demon disciples surrounded. \nAlthough both were on the same Law of evil, but [NAME] had long held malcontent for this group of {1} disciples. [IT] sneered sickeningly and launched a sneak attack against the group of {1} disciples. As they were caught completely off guard, [NAME] was able to deal severe damage to numerous foes in one move. \nBoth sides had been evenly matched, but [NAME]'s surprise attack brought {1} down in no time flat. [NAME] went all out, eliminating the {1} disciples. Now, [NAME] did not like to get entangled with those of the righteous Law. [IT] picked out a few treasures and absconded with them.
[NAME]赶了过去，发现是{1}的内门弟子正在围剿一群正派。\n虽同为正道，[NAME]却与{0}的这几名弟子早有私怨。他偷偷运转法宝，毫无声息的向这帮{0}的弟子发动偷袭。由于毫无防备，[NAME]一招就重创对方数人\n双方本来势均力敌，[NAME]的偷袭使得{0}迅速溃败，[NAME]看局面必死，也没有现出身形，搜了几个无主的宝物便迅速离去。	[NAME] rushed over and discovered that the {1} disciples were encircling those of a righteous sect. \nAlthough they were both of the righteous Law, but [NAME] had actually long held a grudge against these disciples of {0}. [IT] surreptitiously turned [ITS] weapon and launched a sneak attack without so much as a sound on this group of {0} disciples. As they were caught completely off guard, [NAME] was able to deal severe damage to numerous foes in one move. \nBoth sides had been evenly matched, but [NAME]'s surprise attack brought {0} down in no time flat. It looked like that was all she wrote, so [NAME] absconded off with several pieces of treasure.

[IT] surreptitiously turned [ITS] weapon and launched a sneak attack without so much as a sound on this group of {0} disciples. But as [NAME]'s cultivation was not up to snuff, so [ITS] sneak attack was seen through and [IT] was even left exposed. \nThe {0} disciples were unusually incensed by [ITS] sneak attack, they were even willing to risk injury to pull out the ultimate move of the [NAME] sect so as to do some serious damage to [ENHIM]. [NAME] took any Law [IT] could to flee, no matter the cost.
借着绝杀余威，[SCHOOL]的弟子杀出包围，逃离了战场。随后，他们向修行界曝光了[NAME]的卑劣行径。	Living up to their name, the [SCHOOL] disciples slaughtered their way out from a surrounded position to escape the battlefield. Afterwards, they revealed [NAME]'s untoward conduct to the world.
[NAME]搜索了此处，发现了一些原主人留下的宝物。	[NAME] searched the area and found some treasure left behind.
[NAME]搜寻了一番，什么都没有发现。	[NAME] searched the area, but couldn't find anything.
[NAME]运起真气，潜入深潭，没想到越到深处，潭水越寒冷，简直钻心透骨，无法忍耐。就在[NAME]准备放弃时，面前突然出现一片法力开辟的空间，里面放了数件宝光莹然的事物。	[NAME]'s Qi flowed as [IT] dove into the deep pool. [IT] didn't expected that the deeper [IT] went, the colder the water would become. It was like the cold was penetrating [ENHIM] all the way to [ITS] bones. [IT] could hardly bear it. It was just when [NAME] was going to give up that there appeared a space up ahead cleared by magic that had some lustrous items inside.
[NAME]运起真气，潜入深潭，没想到越到深处，潭水越寒冷，简直钻心透骨，无法忍耐。无奈之下，只得作罢。	[NAME]'s Qi flowed as [IT] dove into the deep pool. [IT] didn't expected that the deeper [IT] went, the colder the water would become.

[NAME]并没有找到合适的修行种子。	[NAME] didn't find any potential disciple appropriate for cultivation.

[NAME]寻觅许久，却毫无线索。[IT]知道宝物有缘者得，无奈之下，只得作罢。	[NAME] search for quite some time, but could find no clue. [IT] knew that treasure would only be claimed by those destined to do so. In a helpless situation, the only choice is to give up.
[NAME]觉得还是不要为这种事浪费事件了。	[NAME] thought it's better not to waste time on such things.
[NAME]虽然没找到什么有趣的地方，但也在山野之间别有感悟。	Although [NAME] didn't come across any interesting places, but [IT] was inspired while out in the wilderness.
这里实在太冷了，[NAME]尝试打坐却被彻骨寒意冻得无法入定，只能无奈离开。	It really was entirely too cold here, [NAME] tried to meditate, but couldn't enter a state of meditation due to the bone-chilling cold. In the end, [IT] had no choice but to leave.

[PLACE]实在是太冷了，[NAME]的功力完全无法深入此地，只能无奈离开。	[PLACE] was entirely too cold, so not even [NAME]'s ability was up the task of penetrating this place and so [IT] was left with no choice but to depart.
[NAME]虽然一无所获，但也在山野之间别有感悟。	Although[NAME] left empty handed, [ITS] efforts weren't in vain for [IT] had gained some inspiration while out in the wilderness.
[NAME]找到了不少的特产资源，于是施了个唤风的法诀，将之搬回了门派。	[NAME] had found more than a few special resources, so thereupon [IT] summoned up a wind spell to carry [ENHIM] back to the school.
[NAME]机缘不错，在一处人迹罕至的山坳里发现了宝物。	[NAME] was in luck, as [IT] was able to find treasure off the beaten Law in the mountains.
[NAME]尝试深入寻找，不过这里实在太冷了，[IT]根本无法忍受，只能遗憾离去。	[NAME] tried make [ITS] way in to search, but it was entirely too cold. [IT] had no way to bare it and so had to leave full of regret.
[NAME]上前同[SCHOOL]的长老%s打了声招呼，两人结伴同游[SCHOOL]附近的几处胜地，品风论道，畅谈许久。临分别时，%s长老送你一个自己炼制的小法宝作为纪念。	[NAME] stepped forward and greeted %s, the elder of [SCHOOL]. The two travelled around together to the scenic spots around the [SCHOOL] and had a nice, long chat. When it was time to part ways, the %s elder presented [NAME] with a weapon that [HE] had forged to serve as a memento.
[NAME]上前恭敬的拜见了[SCHOOL]的长老%s，长老很开心的同[NAME]聊了两句，并指点了他几句修行法诀。	[NAME] stepped forward and respectfully greeted the elder of [SCHOOL] %s. The elder was quite delighted to have chat with [ENHIM] and went into detail about some of [ITS] practices.

[SCHOOL]的长老%s看[NAME]装作没看到自己，对你的无礼略感不满。	The [SCHOOL]'s elder %s watched [NAME] pretend that they had not seen him and was not at all pleased by your lack of manners.
[SCHOOL]的长老%s怒极反笑，他出手就是[SCHOOL]的镇派绝招，狠狠攻向[NAME]。[NAME]狞笑一声，祭出自己的法宝迎敌。一时间空中两道流光如惊龙横空斗作一团。	The [SCHOOL]'s elder %s was furious and so pulled out the ultimate technique of the [SCHOOL] school on [NAME]. [NAME] grimaced and brought [ITS] artifact to bear against the enemy. For a time the fighting was like a storm of swords.
两人瞬息间已过手数十招，[NAME]看重一个破绽，拼着自己受伤一招打碎了%s长老的天灵盖，%s长老死状惨烈，神形俱灭。	In a flash the two had exchanged dozens of blows. [NAME] looking for an opportunity took a blow to create one that allowed [ENHIM] to strike their enemy %s the elder on the pate of [ITS] head and thusly [HE] suffered a terrible death.
[SCHOOL]的长老%s怒极反笑，他出手就是[SCHOOL]的镇派绝招，狠狠攻向[NAME]。[NAME]狞笑一声，祭出自己的法宝迎敌。但却错估了对方杀招的威力，竟然被瞬间破去了法宝。	The [SCHOOL]'s elder %s was furious and so pulled out the ultimate technique of the [SCHOOL] school on [NAME]. [NAME] grimaced and brought [ITS] artifact to bear against the enemy. [IT] underestimated the might of the enemy though and [ITS] weapon was broken in a flash.
[NAME]大惊失色，已经失了先机，虽然拼命逃走，但却被%s长老打中致命的一击。	[NAME] lost all color in [ITS] face, losing the advantage, and when [IT] finally found a chance to escape, %s the elder had struck a lethal blow.

[NAME]早已察觉，也故作中招，趁敌人大喜回身之际发出运起全身功力的一击。只一道惊龙般的神光如神矢贯月，瞬间将毫无防备的%s长老打成飞灰。	[NAME] had already sensed it, feigned injury and struck with all [ITS] force while the enemy's back was turned in celebration. A blade whipping through the air like it could pierce the moon took out %s the elder in an instant.

[NAME]拜访了[SCHOOL]的掌门，两人交谈许久，十分尽兴。[SCHOOL]的掌门十分珍惜两派自前代便结下的缘分与交情，于是代表[SCHOOL]将尘封已久的镇派法宝赠与[NAME]，也算是因果纠葛，物归原主。只希望两派可以在将来继续守望相助，友谊长存。	[NAME] visited the sect leader of [SCHOOL], with whom [IT] had a long and enjoyable discussion. The sect leader of [SCHOOL] cherished the friendship and destiny shared by the two schools, so on behalf of [SCHOOL] [HE] presented [NAME] with their most prized weapon.

天地灵根无法移植，[NAME]为防止被他人所获，便想布置一道阵法隐藏其踪迹。	As the Spirit Root connecting heaven and earth cannot be uprooted, [NAME] wanted to conceal it with a spell so as to prevent others from obtaining it.
然而[NAME]尝试之下，却发现天地灵根上通天机，普通阵法完全无法遮蔽其气息。	[NAME] tried, but unfortunately and inexplicably [IT] discovered that the presence of the root could not be concealed using ordinary magic.
[NAME]略一思索，便拿出自身携带的四象遮天图，借助大千世界四季运转之力成功隐藏了灵植的痕迹。	On a whim, [NAME] took out the Painting of the Four Symbols that [IT] had on [ENHIM] and, relying on the assistance of the power of the changing four seasons were able to conceal all traces of the spiritual plant.
然而[NAME]尝试之下，却发现天地灵根上通天机，普通阵法完全无法遮蔽其气息。看来需要以某种遮蔽天机的宝物为引，才能布置完成这一阵法。	[NAME] tried, but unfortunately and inexplicably [IT] discovered that the presence of the root could not be concealed using ordinary magic. It seemed that it would be necessary to use a treasure capable of concealing a mystery of nature in order to complete the spell.

[NAME]想了想，还是决定离开了此处。	[NAME] thought it over, then decided to depart.
[NAME]听闻此地的天地灵根成熟，于是前来收取。虽然[NAME]门派与%s的关系并不怎样，但看守灵根的长老想起自家门派遭遇，只能强忍不满，一脸笑容的上来拜见，并将灵根成熟后的果实尽数给予了[NAME]。	[NAME] heard that the Spirit Root here was ripe and wanted to harvest it. Although [NAME]'s Sect didn't really have any relationship with %s, but the elder watching over the Spirit Root thought of his own Sect's experiences, put on a smile and gave some of its fruit to [NAME].

Even though [NAME]'s sect had always maintained a good relationship with %s, but the fruit of this plant were limited, as such the elder watching over the plant rejected [NAME]'s request. The plant would require another %s days or so for the fruit to ripen, [NAME] can come back at that time.
[NAME]静坐修行，可惜因为在瓶颈之中，一无所获。	[NAME] sat quietly practicing meditation, unfortunately [IT] had run into a wall of sorts and was not able to make any gains.
[NAME]在此地修行了一段时间，觉得修为提升不少。	[NAME] practiced meditation here for a spell and felt that [IT] had made more than a little progress.

[NAME]根本感受不到宝物的气息，但是却觉得此处五行之气与自己十分契合，有一种舒适感。[NAME]寻觅良久未果，只好遗憾离去。	[NAME] could not feel that there was any hint of treasure in the air, but [IT] did feel that the element here was particularly in alignment for [ENHIM] and [IT] was quite comforted by it. [NAME] searched long and fruitlessly. In the end [IT] had to give up.
[NAME]丝毫无法感受宝物的痕迹，反而觉得此处五行与自己并不契合，让自己气息紊乱，[NAME]只得匆匆离去。	[NAME] couldn't sense even the slightest trace of treasure and [IT] even felt that the element here was particularly out of alignment for [ENHIM] here and so [IT] felt that [ITS] Qi was disrupted. [NAME] left post haste.
[NAME]不想在此浪费时间，转头离去。	[NAME] didn't want to waste any time here and so departed post haste.
[NAME]施展法术求雨，在雨水之中，整片林子重现传说之中的景象，涌现出如烟如雾的云气。云气之后，竟然浮现出一座仙人洞府。	[NAME] cast a spell summoning rain. As the rain fell, the whole forest took on its legendary appearance as the clouds started to emerge like mist or smoke. After the clouds dissipated, the abode of an immortal suddenly came into view.
[NAME]搜索了洞府，找到了昔日木白仙人留下的两件宝物。	[NAME] searched the abode and found two pieces of treasure left behind by the immortal.

[NAME]进入剑冢之中。尝试寻找与自己有缘的飞剑。	[NAME] entered the Bladesmith Tomb, trying to seek out [ITS] destined artifact.
[NAME]剑道通神，强烈的剑意竟然获得某种共鸣。剑冢之中猛然飞出一道流光，投入[NAME]手中。	[NAME]'s swordsmanship was supernatural and it was the strong desire to wield a sword well that began to resonate somehow. A burst of light violently flew out of the Bladesmith Tomb straight into [NAME]'s hand.
蜀山剑冢中沉睡多年的神剑，被剑意唤醒，重新出世。	The divine sword that had sleeping soundly for so many years in Mt. Shu's Bladesmith Tomb had been awakened by the strong desire to use a sword well.
然而也许是[NAME]剑道修为不够，并没有神剑与之共鸣。	But, perhaps it was that [NAME]'s swordsmanship had not reached an advanced enough stage, it did not resonate with the divine sword.
[NAME]已经试过一次了，此处并没有神剑与之有缘。	[NAME] tried once, but there was no divine sword here that would intertwine itself with this one's destiny.
[NAME]刚准备进洞，却被一道饱含剑气的声音喝止。[NAME]考虑此地乃是青莲剑宗重地，还是不要乱闯的好。	[NAME] had just began to prepare to enter the cave when a voice resonating with a sense of swordsmanship stopped. [NAME] had thought this place to be where the Blue Lotus Temple is located, and it would better not to rush things.
[NAME]离开了此处。	[NAME] departed.
虽说宝藏诱人，但元磁之心可不是闹着玩的，还是生命更重要。	Although treasure is tempting, but a magnetic heart is no joke. Perhaps life is more important.
[NAME]尝试用神念靠近裂缝，裂缝中突然传来一阵可怕的吸力，将[NAME]的意识卷入其中。在经过一个光怪陆离的通道后，[NAME]来到一个陌生的世界。	[NAME] tried to get closer to the fissure when a freighting force seemed to draw [NAME] into a confused daze. After passing through a bizarre tunnel, [NAME] found a strange, new world on the other side.
你已经探访过这里了。	You've already searched here.
似乎天时有变，此时此刻，空间裂缝阻力奇大，并不能进入。	It seemed as if time and space had shifted, there is an enormous resisting force within the rift and it could not be entered.
此处太过凶险，还是不要过分靠近了。	This place is entirely too dangerous. It'd be better not to get too close.
[NAME]进入离恨海之中，瞬间陷入了层层叠叠的幻境里。离恨海的神秘力量试图挖掘[NAME]过去的悲伤悔恨爱恨离别，然而[NAME]却早已拥有不昧真灵，对那些感情毫无察觉，丝毫不在意。	As soon as [NAME] entered the Safeward Seas, it was as if entering an illusion.

Upon reaching the center of the area, the remains of an Immortal were found. [NAME], grinning, searched through the Immortal's remains and returned back to the sect with all of the booty found on the Immortal.
天缺神剑	Leonardus' Divine Sword
四千年前修行界奇人天缺老人的随身佩剑，天缺老人据说天生智力残缺，如8岁孩童。但他却奇遇连连，以赤子之心入道，修为冠绝当代，最后于离恨海中慨然飞升。	This is the sword carried four thousand years ago by the miracle man and elder Leonardus, who was said to have had deficient mental capabilities from birth, leaving him with the intellect equivalent to an eight-year-old child. But he had Fortuitous Encounters one after the other and began down the Law of the Tao with the mind of a newborn babe. His Cultivation ultimately led to his ascension at Safeward Seas.

[NAME]充满好奇的在离恨海中前进，竟然在离恨海的中心发现了一具仙人遗蜕。[NAME]对仙人遗蜕充满兴趣，但是修为太低，被遗蜕遗留的神秘力量排斥而不得靠近。[NAME]十分不开心，对着遗蜕吐了口口水，气呼呼的离开了此地。	[NAME], full of curiosity, proceeded into the Safeward Seas. Upon reaching the center of the area, the remains of an Immortal were found. [NAME] was incredibly intrigued by the remains of the Immortal, but with insufficient cultivation, was not able to approach due to the intense force which the remains exuded. [NAME] was extremely displeased and spat at the remains in disgust before departing.

Upon reaching the center of the area, the remains of an Immortal were found. [NAME]'s Intelligence was insufficient and so was unable to realize the incredible chance [IT] had by finding the remains of an Immortal and so merely pinched the Immortal's face while grinning like a fool before departing.

As [NAME]'s cultivation was insufficient,  the intense force exuded by the remains made it impossible to approach it and so [IT] was left with no options but to depart.
[NAME]渐渐深入水下，竟然在离恨海的中心发现一片鱼虫绝迹之地。[NAME]颇感奇怪，但没有多想便路过此处。最终一无所获，离开此地。	[NAME] proceeded into the water and discovered the place where the fish and insects had disappeared at the center of the Safeward Seas. [NAME] felt rather odd, but didn't think of it and so proceeded on past the area. In the end, there were no fruits born and so the only option left was to leave.
[NAME]进入离恨海之中，瞬间陷入了层层叠叠的幻境里。[NAME]沉浸在自己的过去中，无法突破那些反复轮回的喜怒哀乐，终于心智崩溃，失去了意识。	As soon as [NAME] entered the Safeward Seas, it was as if entering an illusion. [NAME] became immersed in the past and so was unable to break through those recurring cycles of emotions and in the end had a mental breakdown and lost consciousness.
等[NAME]再次醒来，发现自己躺在离恨海边缘，竟然连一步都没有踏入其中。	After [NAME] woke up on what turned out to be the edge of the Safeward Seas, it became clear that not one step had actually been taken into the area.

没什么事还是不要进去了。	There's no reason to proceed any further into this place.

[NAME]依仗自己的浊之躯不惧瘴毒，架光深入万古桃花瘴之中。然而毒瘴之中视野神识严重受限，[NAME]只得四处摸索。	[NAME] relied on [ITS] Body of Obscurity's lack of fear of miasma and used light to penetrate the Perennial Miasma. The toxic miasma severely limited vision and Perception, the only thing that [NAME]  could do to proceed was to feel out the surroundings.
也是[NAME]机缘不错，竟然发现一尊在毒瘴中保留完整的遗骸。[NAME]一番搜索，找到了几本书册和许多宝物丹药。	It seems that [NAME]'s Luck was not half bad. It turns out that there was a corpse perfectly preserved by the toxic miasma. [NAME] searched around and found some books and ton of treasure and elixirs.

也许[NAME]机缘不够。一番搜索之下，空手而归。	It seems that [NAME]'s Luck was not up to snuff. After searching around, it turns out that there was nothing of interest to be found.
[NAME]依仗自己的浊之躯不惧瘴毒，架光深入万古桃花瘴之中，然而毒瘴之中视野神识严重受限，目不视物。	[NAME] relied on [ITS] Body of Obscurity's lack of fear of miasma and used light to penetrate the Perennial Miasma, but couldn't see a thing due to the thickness of the miasma.
[NAME]运起灵视神观，瞬间毒瘴之中的情景一览无遗。[NAME]向着毒瘴深处进入，竟然发现一尊在毒瘴中保留完整的遗骸，一番搜索之下，[NAME]找到了几本书册和许多宝物丹药。	[NAME] used Descry and it was as if the miasma weren't even there. [NAME] proceeded deep into the toxic miasma where a corpse that had been preserved by the miasma was found. After searching the corpse, [NAME] found several books and a ton of treasure and elixirs.

[NAME]知道此地凶险，如无特殊功法改换体质，万万不可进入。	[NAME] recognized that this place was extremely dangerous, and so without some drastic change in their body, this place could not be entered unaided.
天命阁正门被禁法层层封印，正中悬浮四个字：命定者入。[NAME]刚准备尝试破解禁法，却发现禁法竟然自动展开，将[IT]迎入其中，仿佛等待已久一般。	The front gate of the Pavilion of Fate had been sealed, upon which there were four words written. Only the fated enter. [NAME] had just decided to try to break the seal when gate opened automatically and allowed [ITS] entrance, as if it had long been awaiting just this person.
[NAME]进入天命阁，发现天命阁空空荡荡，只有中心漂浮一把晶莹剔透的法宝，正是南宫红持之渡劫本命法宝。[NAME]取走法宝的同时，就被传送出了天命阁。	[NAME] entered the Pavilion of Fate and found it desolate save for a crystalline artifact floating in the center. It was the ancient immortal Nangong Hong's artifact. [NAME] grasped the artifact and was suddenly whisked out of the Pavilion of Fate.

古仙南宫红持之渡劫的本命法宝。\n[color=#D06508]以此感谢本游戏第一位渡劫成功的玩家：琼楼[/color]	It is said that this Artifact was used by an ancient Immortal named Nangong Hong to Survive Tribulation. \n[color=#D06508]This is in appreciation of the first player to successfully Survive Tribulation: Emerald Palace[/color]

万宝殿中心的玉案上摆放有一个石匣，石匣之上有一道炼制一半的断灵锁。想要取出石匣中的物品，只有将未完成的断灵锁练成才可。	In the Hall of Ten-thousand Treasures there was a stone casket with a lock that was incomplete. The only way to draw the item from the stone casket is to repair the unfinished broken spirit lock.
[NAME]尝试修复断灵锁，所幸其炼器之术精湛，有惊无险的完成了炼制。得到了石匣之中的一册秘籍。	[NAME] attempted to repair the broken spirit lock and was able to do so thanks to excellent ability in Artifact Crafting. [IT] obtained a manual from the stone casket.
[NAME]尝试修复断灵锁，奈何自己对炼器一道着实不太精通，无法完成，只能放弃。	[NAME] attempted to repair the broken spirit lock, but how is one supposed to repair an artifact when they really aren't proficient at artifact crafting? In that situation the only choice is to give up.
[NAME]进入藏经楼之中，发现藏经楼竟然空空荡荡，只有四周的墙壁上仿佛有无数人影或打坐，或腾跃，瞬息千变，眼花缭乱。	[NAME] entered the Scriptorium only to find it empty save for some figures on the walls that appeared to be meditating, leaping, transforming, or in a blur.
[NAME]尝试凝神细看，竟然觉得这些人影之中奥妙无穷，推算之下，从中悟出了一套精妙无比的心法。	[NAME] attempted to look at the figures in detail and found that they seemed to be inexhaustibly profound, and from the incredible depth of it all a brilliant and sophisticated mental cultivation method was discovered.
[NAME]尝试凝神细看，竟然觉得意识一阵模糊，险些昏死过去。想必是因为境界不够，无法参悟这些人影中的信息。[NAME]无奈之下，只能离去。	[NAME] attempted to look at the figures in detail, but felt an abstruse ambiguity from it all and nearly fainted from the effort. Presumably because there was some sort of insufficiency, but regardless nothing of value was able to be discerned from the figures. [NAME] was at a loss and departed.
这里没什么好逛的，还是离开吧。	There's nothing good to look at here, it'd be better to head back.
[NAME]进入仙府在大殿发现一尊栩栩如生，盘膝而坐的塑像，塑像前有一小桌，桌上摆放有一本秘籍与一张符箓。[NAME]知道这便是袁若雪的仙人遗蜕，对遗蜕鞠躬致敬，而后收起桌上的宝物，恭敬离去。	[NAME] entered the Immortal's Abode and discovered a lifelike statue in the audience hall that was seated in front of a small table with its legs crossed. Upon the table, there had been placed a manual and a Taoist talisman. [NAME] knew that this was the remains of the immortal Yuan Ruoxue and so bowed reverently and then took the treasure off the table and left.
[NAME]刚进入仙府，浑身的灵气突然沸腾，竟然有失控的迹象。好像整座仙府的禁制在排斥身负天谴之人的窥探。[NAME]无可奈何，只能离去。	[NAME] entered the Immortal's Abode and had their Qi suddenly surge and took it as a sign of a loss of control. It seemed that the whole of the Immortal's Abode was off limits so as to keep out the prying eyes of the damned. [NAME] was at a loss and departed.
[NAME]仔细探查了阵图，却发现以自己的修为完全不能理解这作阵图的原理。顺着阵法脉络来到阵眼之处，[NAME]竟然发现了四枚凝练而成的天劫之息！	After carefully examining the diagram, it was discovered that this diagram was not in keeping with the cultivation method used by [NAME] and so [IT] could not make head nor tails of it. Arriving at one of the Auxiliaries of the formation by moving along the vein, [NAME] discovered 4 Heaven's Breaths!
“难道这座阵法的作用便是束缚天劫，并利用其量产天劫之息？”[NAME]被自己的猜测震惊了！	"So this formation is actually meant to bind the Heavenly Tribulation and generate Heaven's Breaths? " [NAME]'s own guess seemed to turn the world on its head!
[NAME]仔细研究阵图，然而依然毫无所获，应当是缺少了什么关键的线索。	[NAME] carefully inspected the diagram, but was not able to discern anything of value from it. It seems like there is some sort of clue missing that would unlock the mystery behind it.
此阵闻所未闻，当是青莲仙人飞升前毕生心血所布。不知道青莲仙人留在人间的道统中是否有蛛丝马迹的信息存在。	This formation had never been heard of before. It must be the life's work of the Immortal Caerulea before their ascension. Who knows if there's any information providing any clues that can be found in the extant teachings of the Immortal Caerulea.
[NAME]走到木桌前，发现木桌上摆放有一张阵图。阵图之上有四个凹槽似乎是阵眼之类的关键所在。	Before walking over to the wooden table, [NAME] discovered that there was a diagram of a formation on the table. There were four grooves on the diagram that seemed to be the crux of the center of it.
[NAME]凝神查看，发现东方的凹槽正微微发亮。不过此处阵图已经点亮了。	[NAME] inspected it attentively and discovered that the eastern groove was shining ever so slightly. Though this area of the diagram was already lit up.

[NAME]凝神查看，发现西方的凹槽正微微发亮。	[NAME] inspected it attentively and discovered that the western groove was shining ever so slightly.
[NAME]凝神查看，发现北方的凹槽正微微发亮。不过此处阵图已经点亮了。	[NAME] inspected it attentively and discovered that the northern groove was shining ever so slightly. Though this area of the diagram was already lit up.
[NAME]凝神查看，发现北方的凹槽正微微发亮。	[NAME] inspected it attentively and discovered that the northern groove was shining ever so slightly.
这部分阵图已经被点亮了。	This section of the diagram was already lit up.
[NAME]尝试对发亮的凹槽中注入法力。只见一道道碧绿的条纹从凹槽处快速蔓延，很快就填满了四分之一张阵图。	[NAME] tried to inject some magic into the shiny groove. The only thing that could be seen was a green strip along the groove quickly spread out and fill up a quarter of the diagram.

[NAME]尝试对发亮的凹槽中注入法力。只见一道道漆黑的条纹从凹槽处快速蔓延，很快就填满了四分之一张阵图。	[NAME] tried to inject some magic into the shiny groove. The only thing that could be seen was a black strip along the groove quickly spread out and fill up a quarter of the diagram.
随着最后一片阵图被点亮，整张阵图光华大放。化做一张图卷投入[NAME]怀中	As the last section of the array lit up, the entire diagram shone with an incredible brilliance. It turned into a scroll that was tossed into [NAME]'s arms.
[NAME]尝试对发亮的凹槽中注入法力。没想到阵图上传来一股绝强的反震之力。瞬间将[NAME]的经脉震伤。	[NAME] tried to inject some magic into the shiny groove. Who would have thought that the diagram would have packed such a punch and shook [NAME]'s meridians.
真气反震	Qi Shock
[NAME]尝试对发亮的凹槽中注入法力。然而注入的法力如同泥牛入海，毫无踪迹。	[NAME] tried to inject some magic into the shiny groove. But the magic injected into the diagram vanished without a trace just like a clay oxen plunging into the sea.
[NAME]游览山中景色，竟然发现一件奇怪的事。一般而言，独立大千世界之外的洞天福地往往不具备日升月落，四季流转之变化。然而以自身元神期的修为感应，此处洞天竟然能明显感到节气阴阳的流转，四季变化居然与外界完全一致。	[NAME] visited scenic spots around the mountain and came across something strange. By and large, the Earthly Paradise outside of the Boundless Universe is self-contained and, in most cases, it just let the world carry on as it usually does day to day, year to year and so on. However, with [ITS] cultivated sense of Primordial Spirit, [NAME] found out that [IT] can sense the flow of Yin and Yang as well as the Solar Period in this Earthly Paradise, despite its seclusion from the world outside. Its changes of the four seasons and those in mortal realm were in perfect synchronization.
“这是沟通大千小千的大神通啊！”意识到这一点的同时，[NAME]被道法无垠之玄妙震撼，竟然大有所悟。	"This is the great miracle of the Boundless and Bounded Universes in perfect synchronization. " Upon coming to this realization, [NAME] was shaken by abstruse profundity of Tao and suddenly had something of an epiphany.
[NAME]游览山中景色，觉得此地仙境真的美轮美奂。不过[NAME]总觉得这里和自己去过的其他洞天福地有什么不一样的地方。	[NAME] visited scenic spots around the mountain and found the paradise about to be magnificent. Though [NAME] had always found that there was something different about this place compared with the other Earthly Paradises visited previously.
“毕竟是青莲仙人缔造的仙境，有些不同也是理所应当嘛！”[NAME]并没有深究这件事。	"It is, after all, the paradise created by the Immortal Caerulea, it should be natural to find some differences here! " [NAME] had not gotten to the bottom of this matter.
[NAME]漫步游览，发现此时如外界一般，正是春天时分，万物复苏。	[NAME] strolled around and found that this time was spring just like external world, everything thriving.
[NAME]漫步游览，发现此时如外界一般，正是夏天时分，烈日高照。	[NAME] strolled around and found that this time was summer just like external world, the sun was shining intensely high up in the sky.
[NAME]漫步游览，发现此时如外界一般，正是秋天时分，满山金红。	[NAME] strolled around and found that this time was autumn just like external world, it was as if the mountains were ablaze, like a sea of crimson and gold the leaves were turning.
[NAME]漫步游览，发现此时如外界一般，正是冬天时分，银装素裹。	[NAME] strolled around and found that this time was winter just like external world, it was as if a ivory powder had been cast over the land.
[NAME]无意之间发现了登仙台上杂乱的纹理竟然是反向书写的古代篆文，他将所有的篆文转录下来并施法，成功打开了一间隐藏的密室，并获得了东华帝君留下的传承。	[NAME] had inadvertently discovered that the chicken scratch on the Immortal Summit was in fact the reflected image of ancient Chinese seal script. Transcribing the characters and then casting the incantation that [IT] spelled out, [IT] successfully opened a hidden chamber that contained the inheritance leftover by the emperor Donghua.
[NAME]尽可能的探索了登仙台的每一寸土地，但还是一无所获。	[NAME] searched every inch of the Immortal Summit as best as one could, but had no results to show for it.
东华帝君的遗迹已经被有缘人得到，[NAME]欣赏了一下此处的风景就离开此地。	Whatever possessions the Donghua Emperor had left behind had been taken by some lucky fellow some time ago, so [NAME] just took in the scenery and then left.
[NAME]怀着虔诚之心进入飞雷洞，发现此地布置异常简单，只有一张石床和一张石桌，除去石桌上四角有四个似乎久用而磨出的凹痕，并没有什么异常。	With a pious heart, [NAME] entered Thunderclap Cave and found that the area was remarkably spartan, there was naught more than a stone bed and table. If one were to ignore that the stone table with four indentations that seemed like they were created on purpose, there would be nothing remarkable herein.
[NAME]行礼以示尊敬，刚准备离开此地，突然福至心灵。[NAME]竟然莫名想起青莲山山腰竹庐中的神秘阵图。	[NAME] saluted in respect, and while just about to leave, [IT] suddenly had an epiphany. [NAME] suddenly and inexplicably recalled to mind the mysterious diagram of an array in the bamboo hut on the side of Mt. Caerulea.
“这其中一定有关联！”[NAME]心中巨震，但知道此地有一位蜀山的太上长老看守，只能暂时假装神色不变的离开此地	"This definitely has some sort of connection with that! " [NAME]'s heart was greatly shaken, but knew that one of the Grand Supreme Elders of Mt. Shu keeps watching over this place and so could only leave while feigning indifference.
[NAME]再次来到石桌前，果然发现四象遮天图微微颤动，似乎有所感应。然而此时此地，在蜀山太上长老的看守下，[NAME]并不敢轻举妄动……	[NAME] came before the stone table once again and discovered that, as expected, the Painting of the Four Symbols was vibrating slightly as if it there was some sort of reaction going on. But at this time and place, with the Grand Supreme Elder of Mt. Shu keeping watching over this place, [NAME] did not dare to act rashly…
该怎么办呢？是否要通知蜀山联合调查？[NAME]若有所思，先行离开此地。	What's to be done? Should Mt. Shu be informed about this? As if lost in thought, [NAME] went ahead and left.
[NAME]再次来到石桌前，想到已经从青莲仙山取得的四象遮天图，暗自琢磨此物是否是关键所在。	[NAME] came before the stone table once again and recalled the Painting of the Four Symbols obtained from Mt. Caerulea. [IT] wondered if that object might be the key.
[NAME]再来飞雷洞，观察凹痕，却并没有什么新的线索发现。一番探查后无果，只能暂时离去。	[NAME] returned to Thunderclap Cave and investigated the indentations, but there were no discernable clues to be found. After searching with no fruit to bear of it, the only choice left was to depart for the time being.
[NAME]怀着虔诚之心进入飞雷洞，发现此地布置异常简单，只有一张石床和一张石桌，除去石桌上四角有四个似乎久用而磨出的凹痕，并没有什么异常。[NAME]行礼以示尊敬，便离开了此地。	With a pious heart, [NAME] entered Thunderclap Cave and found that the area was remarkably spartan, there was naught more than a stone bed and table. If one were to ignore that the stone table with four indentations that seemed like they were created on purpose, there would be nothing remarkable herein. [NAME] saluted in respect and then departed.
[NAME]敏锐的捕捉到了那一丝灵光，盘膝而坐，自丹霞绝壁的奇景中参悟出一套心法。	[NAME] was keen to capture even the slightest bit of inspiration, and thus with legs crossed began to meditate searching for inspiration all while surrounded by the majestic landscape of the Sunshade Precipice.
[NAME]苦苦思索，但是始终无法抓住那一闪而逝的灵光，只得无奈离去。	[NAME] thought long and hard but was unable to grasp that fleeting ray of inspiration and so had to depart.

[NAME]神游之间，突然冥冥之中闪过一道灵光，眼前翻涌的云雾似乎形成一道神奇的轨迹。[NAME]凝神细看，却发现这道轨迹缺多有残缺，无法识别。[NAME]只得将这纹理记下来，带回了门派。	While lost in a daydream, [NAME] was hit like a lightning bolt with a ray of inspiration as the clouds passing by seemed to trace out a miraculous trajectory in the sky. [NAME] looked attentively and found that the trajectory was lacking somehow and so was unable to discern anything from it. [NAME] could only record the texture and head back to the School.

[NAME]欣赏了一会这里的景色，随后离开了此地。	[NAME] took in the scenery before departing.
[NAME]神游之间，突然发现眼前梧桐木上的纹理似乎并非天然生成，细看之下，却发现似乎残缺了一半，无法识别。[NAME]只得将这纹理记下来，带回了门派。	While daydreaming, [NAME] discovered that the texture on the nearby sycamore was not at all a natural formation. As a result, it was only half complete and thus nothing was able to be discerned from it. [NAME] could only record the texture and head back to the School.

[NAME]发现洞口的纹理似乎和《太上忘情道》扉页上所画的代表极天宫的符号有些相似，但又有许多不同。[NAME]以各种手法试探这些符号，但毫无结果，只能离去。	[NAME] discovered that the texture at the mouth of the cave bore a resemblance to the symbols on the Skydome Palace on the cover of the "Emotion Severing Law." There was a lot that was different though. [NAME] used all means available to feel out these symbols, but it bore no fruit and so [IT] left.
[NAME]对此处的探索毫无头绪，只得离去。	[NAME] had no clue about this place and so left.

[NAME]看着石壁上天然生成的纹路，不禁再次感慨造化神奇。	[NAME] gazed upon the texture that had naturally formed on the stone wall and could not help but sigh at the majesty of nature.
[NAME]发现造化玉籽已经凝结，于是按照秘法将其采集下来。	[NAME] discovered that Fortune Seed seemed to be condensing and so gathered them together according to a secret method.

%s上裂纹密布，似乎随时可能损坏了……	The cracks on %s were many, it looks like at any moment it would prove one too many.
随着[NAME]的元神回归本体，%s发出一声清脆的声音，碎裂为粉末。	As [NAME]'s Primordial Spirit returned whence it came, a clear sound resonated from %s as it cracked, turning into dust.
[NAME]并没有练就元神，根本无法读取其中的信息。	[NAME] had not mastered the Primordial Spirit by any means and thus had no means by which to draw out any information from it.
[NAME]打开了信笺，发现信上只写了“仙途之约，轮回再续”这八个让人一头雾水的字。信笺最后并附了一张地图，似乎是去某个地点的路。	[NAME] opened the letter and discovered written inside was nothing more than the following: "The covenant of the Immortal way is continued on the next Reincarnation." The letter also had a map attached that seemed to indicate the means by which to arrive at some location.

[NAME]仔细的研究了这个奇怪的物件，只觉得构成封印的能量似乎与这个世界格格不入，竟然无比排斥灵气的渗透。如果用强，甚至会导致此物彻底湮灭。正当[NAME]束手无策之际，竟然从封印的手法上发现了一丝熟悉的味道。	After careful study of this strange object, [NAME] felt that its energy was incompatible with this world and even repelled one's Qi. If one tries to lift the seal by force, it may even lead to the destruction of the object. Just as [NAME] was at a loss, something familiar became apparent about the sealing technique.

[NAME]遵循记忆中的手法，轻而易举的解开了封印。异界气息散去的同时，其中的物件也暴露了出来。而物件之上还附着有一段神念信息，果然是四师兄所留。[NAME]欣喜万分，激活了四师兄留下的神念。	[NAME] easily broke the seal relying solely on memory. As aura from a foreign world coalesced, something appeared. And there was a message from the fourth master upon it. [NAME] activated the message.

[NAME]仔细思索，终于想起这封印手法竟然是太一门中独传的一种偏门封印术，据说当年也只有四师兄李太一擅长此法。	[NAME] thought carefully, and realized that this sealing technique was one unique to the Taiyi Sect.
“难道当年灭门夜，四师兄并没有陨落？此物竟然和四师兄有关联？”[NAME]心神激荡，振奋非常，连忙从记忆中回忆此术的解印之法。	"So the fourth master didn't pass when the Sect was Destroyed back then? This has to do with the fourth master then? "[NAME] was excited and even was able to recall the method for breaking the seal.
[size=12][color=#000000]      我乃太一门四弟子李太一，当年太一门大祸，我于危难之中寻得一线生机，流落异界数十年，归家无门。数十年求索，只寻得一些奇门异法，将神念寄托于物件之上，送入虚空，不知这些杂物能否度过虚空中的重重危机，抵达家乡世界？此物以太一门独门封印封锁，如有人可见此信息，必是万幸天不绝我太一！就是不知是哪位师兄，师弟当面？现如今我太一度过危难与否？当年仇人是谁？不管如何，只要有人看到这段信息，打开封印，我就会产生感应，便能证明横渡虚空是可能的，真想马上回归家乡，与你一同手刃仇人，复兴太一。\n      也许太久无人可以说心里话，忍不住想说说这些年的经历，我流落的这方世界也是一个有人类的世界，似乎刚刚从一次灭世战争中恢复过来。只是此地灵气匮乏，并没有修行之道，这些人类以凡人手段竟然能打到世界毁灭，还真得是不可思议。\n      这些年，我暂住在一个叫“波西亚”的城镇里，这里的生活还不错，除了总是被催促做“箱子如何了？”。此地灵气匮乏，但是这里的凡人居然能以特殊手段驾驭“雷霆之力”。逐渐熟悉之下，我也找到了一些利用雷霆之力增幅修为，尝试破碎虚空的方法，似乎看到了回家的希望，这是第四次尝试，希望一切顺利吧……这次寄托神念的物品，都是我这些年收集的一些此地有趣的设施建筑，想必能看到这些信息的你也都得到了，虽然不一定有用，但也收下留个纪念吧！\n      祝愿陌生的同门一切安好，祝太一长存！[/color][/size]	[size=12][color=#000000]      I am the fourth disciple of the Taiyi, Li Taiyi. During the Taiyi disaster back then I found a ray of hope as I ended up in another realm for decades. After decades of searching, we only found ways to imbue items with our thoughts and pass them through the void…though who knows if they actually made it all the way through to the other side… This is using a seal unique to the Taiyi Sect. If anyone else saw this… This means our sect survives in a way! But which master was it? Have the Taiyi passed through the crisis? Who was the enemy back then? Regardless, there only needed to be someone to see this, to open the seal, and I'll be able to prove it's possible to cross the void. I want to return home immediately, to see you all, and to revive the Taiyi. \n      Haven't been able to speak from my heart for years, I can't help but want to tell you about my journey. This world that I have wandered into also has humans and it felt as if it had just recovered from an apocalyptic war. There was a distinct lack of Qi here, yet these people were able to destroy the world. It's incredible. \n      These years, I've been living in a town called "Portia." It's not bad other than when I'm urged to make a box. ". Qi is lacking here, yet the commoners are able to command the "Power of Thunder." Gradually becoming more familiar, I also found some ways to use the power of thunder to augment Cultivation and to try to break the void. This is the 4th try, hopefully everything goes smoothly… Everything entrusted to you were gathered by me during my stay, and it must be said that despite what's happened here, the commoners are all optimistic.

If you can, it would be fortunate indeed. \n      I am the fourth disciple of the Taiyi, Li Taiyi. During the Taiyi disaster back then I found a ray of hope as I ended up in another realm for decades. After decades of searching, we only found ways to imbue items and pass them through the void…though who knows if they actually made it all the way through to the other side… No matter what, whoever lifts the seal on this will trigger my magic, and I'll know your whereabouts across the void between the realms. At that time, I will be able to cross the void… Though hope is frail, it's still better than being trapped in a world full of strangers. I hope to return with you back home as soon as possible, to revive the Taiyi! \n      Haven't been able to speak from my heart for years, I can't help but want to tell you about my journey. This world that I have wandered into also has humans and it felt as if it had just recovered from an apocalyptic war. There was a distinct lack of Qi here, yet these people were able to destroy the world. It's incredible. \n      I've been living in a town called "Portia" these years.

[size=12][color=#000000][/color]      看到这条消息的人，可是我太一弟子？这么多年过去，如太一弟子能看到此物，我太一必然已逃过大难。不知我太一近况如何？是否已然复兴？\n      我乃太一门四弟子李太一，当年太一门大祸，我于危难之中寻得一线生机，流落异界已三十余年。这些年，我暂住在一个叫“波西亚”的城镇中。虽然此地灵气匮乏，但是这里的凡人居然能以特殊手段驾驭“雷霆之力”。这几十年摸索，我也能驾驭这种特殊的雷霆之力增幅修为，并破碎虚空，只是以我的修为，只有一次机会横渡虚空，如果不能定位到家乡世界的方向，实在十死无生。这些投递的物品便是引信，一旦有人开启，我便可获得方向定位。这是第四十三次尝试，希望天见可怜能顺利抵达……此地灵气匮乏，我已许久不动修为，一直过着凡人的生活。这次寄托神念的物品，都是这些年喜欢的一些食物，看来凡人的日子过得久了，也开始贪图口腹之欲了，如果你能收到，不知道还能不能吃，不管怎样也算留个纪念吧！\n      祝愿陌生的同门一切安好，祝太一长存！[/size]	[size=12][color=#000000][/color]      So is it one of my Taiyi Disciples that is reading the Message? It's been so many years, but, being able to see this, the Taiyi Sect must have survived the catastrophe. How is the Taiyi Sect? Has it been revived then? \n     I am the fourth disciple of the Taiyi, Taiyi Li. During the Taiyi disaster back then I found a ray of hope as I ended up in another realm for over 30 years. I've been living in a town called "Portia" these years. The Qi is deficient here, yet the commoners can manipulate lightning. I learned to use this special power of thunder over the decades, and use it to break through the void. Though with my Cultivation… I only have one chance to cross the void. If I can't identify the exact location of our home world, I'll definitely die during the process. These items I sent are my beacons across the void. Once someone lift the seal on them, I'll be able to know the location of our realm. This is the 43rd try, hopefully it will go smoothly… There really isn't enough Qi here…I've given up Cultivation long ago. I live as a commoner. This time I sent you some of my favorite foods. Having been live as a commoner for too long, It looks like I began to develop pampered appetites. Perhaps it'd be better not to eat what I sent, but leaving a memorial won't hurt! \n      Long Live the Taiyi Sect![/size]
[size=12][color=#000000][/color]      看到这条消息的人，应是我太一传人罢？百年过去，不知道太一门如今是何等气象？\n      我乃太一门四弟子李太一，当年太一门大祸，我于危难之中寻得一线生机，流落异界已百年。早些年，我暂住在一个叫“波西亚”的城镇中。后来便开始浪迹天涯，周游此界。虽然此地灵气匮乏，但是这里的凡人居然能以特殊手段驾驭“雷霆之力”。这百年摸索，我也能驾驭这种特殊的雷霆之力，并借此破碎虚空，只是我在此地无法修行，是以百年难有进境，以我的修为，只有一次机会横渡虚空，如果不能定位到家乡世界的方向，实乃十死无生的结局。是以百年来我不断的投递一些附着神念的物品，希望借助这些物品的开启以获得方向定位。然而，百余年竟然毫无回音。这是第一百二十二次尝试，也会是最后一次尝试。我寿元无多，一年之后如无回音，便会孤注一掷，总好过在这异界老死。这次寄托神念的物品是我最后的收藏，这个世界以凡人之躯经天纬地，实乃奇迹。无量天尊，太一列祖列宗在上，也望奇迹诞生，保佑弟子能回归家乡。\n          万般法术，千种大道，可长生否？\n              诸界穿行，遍览风物，何处为家？\n                  —— 迷途之人李太一  问天于此\n      祝愿陌生的同门一切安好，祝太一长存！[/size]	[size=12][color=#000000][/color]      The person that saw this message must have been one of the Taiyi? A hundred years have gone by, I don't know a thing about how the Taiyi Sect has been faring. \n      I am the fourth disciple of the Taiyi, Taiyi Li. During the Taiyi disaster back then I found a ray of hope as I ended up in another realm for over a hundred years. I've been living in a town called "Portia" for many a year. Later I set to roving the world. The Qi is deficient here, yet the commoners can manipulate lightning. I learned to use this special power of thunder over the years, and use it to break through the void. Though with my Cultivation… I only have one chance to cross the void. If I can't identify the exact location of our home world, I'll definitely die during the process. I've been sending objects nonstop for a hundred years, hoping one of them would become activated. Yet no one ever came. This is the 122nd and final try. I can't go on forever. If there's still no response after a year, I'll start on the journey across the void whatsoever. At least it's better than dying of old age in this strange world. These items entrusted to you are the last of my collections. The world uses commoners to rule, it's a miracle indeed. If only a Miracle would allow for safe passage back home. \n          With all types of magic, is immortality really possible? \n              Where is home when you travel throughout the worlds? \n                  —The lost Li Taiyi asks the heavens here\n      I wish my fellow disciple all the best, may your lives be long![/size]

据《上古异闻·仙魔之战·卷一》记载，上古时期，三皇飞升后，只有东皇在人间留下道统，号称东皇宫。其势力横压当代，举世无敌，是不折不扣的正道魁首。在其带领下，两次仙魔大战人间界都获得胜利，其声威冠盖上古，无人不知，无人不晓。	According to "Ancient Secrets: Heavenly Battlefield, Volume I," after the Three Sovereigns ascended, only the Eastern Sovereign left their teachings behind at the Eastern Palace. The sect's power was without equal, to the extent that it was celebrated across the entire realm. Under its rule, humans achieved victory in both of the Wars between Immortals and Demons. There were none that didn't know of their might.
据《上古异闻·仙魔之战·卷五》记载，第二次仙魔大战开战在即，东皇宫统领人间修行者建立统一战线抵抗魔界，然而紫霄宗却依仗自己正道根脚，不服管束。关键时刻当霹雳行事，东皇掌教亲自出手杀灭紫霄宗抗命的七大长老，收束军心，最终统一战线得以建立，于第二次仙魔大战中获得惨胜。此役因紫霄宗事变产生剧烈内耗，导致修行界损失惨重，东皇宫迫紫霄宗立下誓言，为第三次仙魔大战先锋，将功赎罪。	According to "Ancient Secrets: Heavenly Battlefield, Volume V," when the Second War between Immortals and Demons is near at hand and he Eastern Palace is preparing a united front, the Purple Cloud Temple is not falling in line. With extraordinary daring and resolution, the Sect leader of the Eastern Palace personally executed seven elders of the Purple Cloud Temple for defiance of orders, restoring discipline to the army of cultivators. The united front was thusly established and a Pyrrhic victory in the war was won. This Purple Cloud Temple incident cause internal friction that led to problems for the world of cultivators. The Eastern Palace forced the Purple Cloud Temple to make a vow to seek atonement by taking the lead in the Third War of Immortals and Demons.
据《上古异闻·仙魔之战·卷七》记载，第二次仙魔大战，十大邪教勾结魔头，险些导致人间覆灭。东皇宫掌教以身祭天道，重现东皇法身，以雷霆手段重创十大邪教，令其几乎全部覆灭，这才终于在第二次仙魔大战中获得惨胜。	According to "Ancient Secrets: Heavenly Battlefield: Volume VII," during the Second War, two evil Sects colluded with a great evil, which brought about the end of the world. The Sect Leader of the Eastern Palace sacrificed himself to the Creed of Heaven so that the Eastern Sovereign would reap and destroy the ten heretics. A great, but bitter, victory in the Second War was won.
据《上古异闻·仙魔之战·卷十五》所说，上古时期，人间界在东皇宫的带领下，取得两次仙魔大战的胜利。然而两次大战，修行界皆为惨胜。巨大的损失令东皇宫之中有一派人对第三次仙魔大战生出悲观态度，是以倾尽天下修行界之力打造出至宝“乾坤界”，以希望灾难来临时能遁入其开辟的小千世界中躲过灾难，为人间留下火种。	According to "Ancient Secrets: Heavenly Battlefield, Volume XV," mankind won two wars between the Immortals and Demons in ancient times. The two wars were bitter victories for those of the world of cultivators. The great loss filled a group in the Eastern palace with pessimism regarding a third war between the Immortals and Demons. There is a wish to create a "Universe" using magic into which escape would be possible were disaster ever to come.
[NAME]阅读《太一秘典》，遍览了太一门百年前立派到如今的种种大事，在书册最后，还记载了一种奇特的名为“小乾坤界”的建筑的建造方法。[NAME]一方面感慨“小乾坤界”的精妙，一方面回想起师门种种，不禁百感交集。	[NAME] read the "Secret Codex of Taiyi," and learned about the history of the Sect from its founding. At the end of the book, there was an odd inscription about constructing a building called the "Mini Universe." [NAME] was fascinated by the Mini Universe, and had mixed feelings about the destroyed Taiyi Sect.
[NAME]琢磨传说中的古代至宝“乾坤界”和自己从太一门秘穴中获得的“小乾坤界”，觉得其中肯定有什么特殊的联系。一番思索后，[NAME]突然察觉到小乾坤界的阵法符印，似乎可以套用到古代秘印的解印法中。如果以这种方法解印《太一密典》会怎么样呢？[NAME]尝试之下，《太一秘典》上光华闪过，文字变幻，竟然展现出完全不一样的内容，揭露出一段湮没在历史中的隐秘！	[NAME] ruminated on the connection between the ancient "Universe" and the "Mini Universe" discovered. After thinking things over, [NAME] realized the Mini Universe formation should be able to be applied to lifting the ancient seal. What would happen if this were used on the "Secret Codex of Taiyi"? [NAME] tried and the "Secret Codex of Taiyi" flashed, the characters changed, a secret lost to history was revealed!
据《太一秘典》记载，上古时期，人间修行界的领袖乃是三皇传承之一的东皇宫，其实力威压天下，无人不从。只是千年前一场大变故使东皇宫几乎灭派，变故之后，东皇宫成为修行界的禁忌，其资料历史尽数被销毁，至此仿佛从未存在。而百余年后，其残留一支隐秘的传承悄然出世，为避人耳目，他们另立一派，其名为：太一门！	According to the "Secret Codex of Taiyi," the Eastern Palace was the leader of cultivation world, all followed such incredible might. It was a great change thousands of years ago that almost wiped out the Eastern Palace's sect. Their Law became a taboo, and all evidence of it all but wiped out of existence. Over a century later, a hidden secret that had been hidden from the world appeared, and they established a Sect known as: The Taiyi Sect!
[NAME]阅读残卷，发现其上的信息牛头不对马嘴，完全不知道在说什么。	[NAME] read the scroll fragments and found that it made no sense whatsoever.

The Eastern Palace became infected by the evil energy during the war and ended up wanting to subvert the world. The Eastern Palace's sect leader was even known as the Demon among Demons, dominating the world with unparalleled cultivation power. \nIn order to survive, cultivators of the world united to fight against the Eastern Palace regardless of good and evil, for over a decade before eventually destroying it.

数日游历之间，[NAME]发现此地贴在门窗之上的字符除了喜庆之外，竟然别有奥妙。而此地别具一格的灯笼烟花也让[NAME]喜爱非常。然而正当[NAME]兴致勃勃的准备继续查探时，却突然察觉异界裂缝似乎开始波动，[NAME]只得驱动元神，返回了肉身。	Travelled for a few days, [NAME] discovered that people here put up images on their doors and windows that didn't just wish for good fortune and happiness, but that also had some other mysterious meaning. What's more [NAME] really loved the unusual lanterns in this place. But, just as [NAME] was excitedly preparing to continue investing, they realized that the Parellia Rift was starting to vibrate. [NAME] had to expend maximum effort just to make it back in time.
几日异界见闻让[NAME]大有所悟，[IT]将所见所闻记录与书册之上，带回了门派。	Just a few days had quite an impact on [NAME]. [IT] recorded what had been seen and heard and took it back to the School.
[NAME]运转元神升空而起，打量四周，发现自己正身处一座巨大的凡人城市之上，这座城市十分奇特，竟有无数高达百米的建筑，其规模之大更是超出[NAME]之前见过的任意一座大城，其中人口稠密，恐有千百万之数，似乎正处在某个庆典之中。其天空竟然有数只钢铁巨鸟排成阵型风驰电掣呼啸而过，其速度甚至不输普通飞剑，简直闻所未闻。	[NAME] used the Primordial Spirit to soar up, look around, found there was a huge, if strange, city all around. There were innumerable immensely tall buildings and the city was larger than any [NAME] had ever seen, and it was also so dense that millions could live there. It also seemed that some sort of celebration was going on. There appear to be metal birds flying in the sky… They're even faster than artifacts! That's unheard of!
[NAME]大感兴趣，便以读心之法收集城中居民的信息。这才知道此地乃炎黄国，其时正为国诞之时，普天同庆之下，其国运如烈火烹油，直冲霄汉。[NAME]恍然，也正是这股庞大的气运之力透过空间裂缝，让自己得以定位感知。	[NAME]'s curiosity was more than piqued, and began to collect information about the residents. It was only then that it became clear that this was the country of Cathay. It wasn't just any day either, it was the country's National Day. [NAME] suddenly realized that it was the aura of the country's fortune emitting through the crack in space that enabled the location to be perceived.
如此凝聚的国运，可谓闻所未闻。“如此大国是如何建立？”[NAME]对这个国家的历史产生了浓烈的兴趣。	Such a momentum of fortune is unheard of. "How was such a great nation built? " [NAME] developed an intense interest in this country's history.
[NAME]找到此地名为“图书馆”的地方，查看起这个凡人国度的历史。不禁深深地为之沉迷。自今向古追溯，此国数以千年的思想传承虽然繁杂，但其根脚完全不输于自己本来世界的任何一种心法理论。尤其是其源自“诸子百家”的思想竟然与自身修炼之道大有补益和启发。	[NAME] found this place called a "Library," the history of the peoples here can be found inside. They became deeply fascinated by it. Looking back through history, this country has see complicated changes in thought across thousands of years, but its not inferior to the world that [NAME] came from with regards to schools of thought. Their Hundred Schools of Thought had so much in common with the cultivation sects pursuing truth and personal development, and they were of great benefit and inspiration regarding the great Law toward immortality.
[NAME]在此地一留便是数日，如痴如醉。然而异界裂缝似乎开始波动，[NAME]只得驱动元神，返回了肉身。	[NAME] stay here a few days, becoming infatuated with the place. However, the Otherworld Rift began to fluctuate, [NAME] had to drive the Primordial Spirit and return.
[NAME]将近日所读之册以神念转录，带回了门派。	[NAME] transcribed the book they've read, then returned to the Sect with them.
叶玄身形一动，便把[NAME]身上的骰子捞在手里把玩了两下，随后便答应了你的要求。	Ye Xuan snatched the dice off [NAME] and cast them twice, then agreed to your request.
叶玄瞥了[NAME]一眼，便专心桌上的赌局。不在理会[NAME]。	Ye Xuan glanced at [NAME] then focused on the commotion at the table. They weren't paying attention to [NAME].
[NAME]想了想，还是不要招惹此人为妙。	[NAME] thought it over and decided it's best not to provoke this person.
[NAME]的寿元已经不足五十年……	[NAME] has less than 50 years left to live…
[NAME]抽到的两张算筹分别为：%s,%s。	[NAME] drew two counting rods: %s, %s.
那么猜测双方算筹之差为多少呢？	How would one guess how different the two are?
[NAME]想了想，赌博害人，还是赶紧离开吧。	[NAME] thought it over and decided that gambling was too risky and decided to leave.
叶玄猜%s。	Ye Xuan guessed %s.
叶玄展示抽到的两张算筹，分别为：%s,%s。双方之差为：%s。	Ye Xuan demonstrated that the two counting rods drawn were, respectively: %s, %s. The difference between the two being %s.
[NAME]赢了！	[NAME] won!
[NAME]输了！寿元减少五十年！	[NAME] lost! And like that their Lifespan decreased by a whole 50 years!
竟然是平局，只得此局作罢。	It was a draw so they had to give up on this round.
叶玄被[NAME]赢了三局，不甘心的舔舔嘴唇，结束了今天的赌局。	Ye Xuan was beaten by [NAME] 3 times, unwilling to take more licks, that was it for the day.
[NAME]以《太上忘情道》所修炼的灵气将地下的纹理一一补全。在符号完整的一瞬间，[NAME]眼前仿佛一片迷雾飞过。眨眼之间，面前的景象已然变得截然不同！	[NAME] used the Qi cultivated using the "Emotion Severing Law" to fill in the underground texture. In the instant that the symbol was completed, it was as if a cloud of fog had flashed by. In the blink of an eye, the scene in front had become as different as night and day!
[NAME]以灵气将地下的纹理一一补全。然而却无事发生过。似乎这些纹理对[NAME]的灵气并无反应……[NAME]又做了各种尝试，依然毫无反应，只得遗憾离去。	[NAME] used the Qi  to fill in the underground texture. Yet nothing happened. It seems that these textures had some sort of effect on [NAME]'s Qi… [NAME] tried everything conceivable, but it had no effect and so gave up and left.
[NAME]离开了此处。	[NAME] departed.
[NAME]仔细调查了石壁，很快发现了一些奇异之处。这些石壁上的图形，似乎透出某种道理，似乎正与《太上忘情道》的运功路线同源同理。难道昔日天极老祖就是于此领悟出《太上忘情道》这门功法的么？	[NAME] carefully inspected the stone wall and found some peculiarities. These figures on the wall seemed to have some sort of sense to them and it seemed that they displayed some of the same principles as found in the "Emotion Severing Law." Could it be that it was here that the "Emotion Severing Law" came to be?
[NAME]仔细体悟，对照自己对功法的理解，大有参悟！	[NAME] made great advancements in understanding by comparing with one's own understanding of the Law!
[NAME]仔细调查石壁，隐隐之间察觉到石壁上的符号似乎隐藏着什么信息。但是[NAME]却始终抓不到那一丝灵感，只得作罢。	[NAME] carefully inspected the stone wall. It became clear that the markings held some secret message. Unfortunately, the ray of hope remained out of reach for [NAME] and so there was no other choice but to give up.
[NAME]看着石壁上天然生成的纹路，不禁再次感慨造化神奇。	[NAME] gazed upon the texture that had naturally formed on the stone wall and could not help but sigh at the majesty of nature.
[NAME]拿下《山河诀》，简单翻阅，明白了事情的始末。	[NAME] grabbed "Chant of Mountains and Rivers," flipped through it and came to understand the event from beginning to end.
原来此人果然是天极老祖，这册山河诀乃是老祖从龙脉运转中领悟的秘法，可以改造山川地脉。如果借助此地每年凝结一次的“造化玉籽”，甚至可以凝聚地脉沉淀千万年之灵气，造化灵土。	As it turned out, this was the Celestial Patriarch and this manual is the Secret Law that he came to understand from the circulation of Dragon's Vein, it is capable of rebuilding terrain. If one were to take advantage of the annually formed "Fortune Seed," it would even be possible to condense down the Qi of ten thousand years worth of this earthly soil creating spiritual soil in the process.
[NAME]收起《山河诀》并按照其中的秘法，将造化玉籽采了下来。	[NAME] put away the "Chant of Mountains and Rivers" and harvested the Fortune Seed according to the Secret Law described therein.
[NAME]想了想，觉得不能浪费这具遗蜕，决定自己收走这具遗蜕。	[NAME] thought it over and thought it wouldn't do to waste these remains and so decided to take them.
[NAME]刚刚挪动遗蜕，只见一阵光华闪烁。洞壁之上的玄奥符号以及尽数消失殆尽了。	[NAME] had just moved the remains when there was a sudden flash of light. The abstruse symbols on the cave wall had all vanished.
[NAME]想了想，觉得还是将遗蜕送还极天宫吧！	[NAME] thought it over and thought it would be better to return the remains to the Skydome Palace!
[NAME]想了想，觉得还是尊重天极老祖自身的意愿，就让其遗蜕永远坐镇此处吧！	[NAME] thought it over and thought it better to respects the wishes of the Celestial Patriarch and leave the remains where they were.
[NAME]归还天极老祖遗蜕，极天宫全派上下感激万分。	[NAME] returned the Celestial Patriarch's remains and all those in the Skydome Palace assembled to express their sincerest thanks.
极天宫表示，昔日老祖留言，如若昔日遗蜕归位，可将此玉匣送与来人。[NAME]接过玉匣一看惊喜万分，竟然是两颗造化玉籽！看极天宫的态度，他们似乎并不知道此物妙用。	The Skydome Palace let it known that the elder had left a message behind all the way back then stating that if his remains were ever returned that this jade chest be bestowed upon the one that returned them. After receiving the jade chest, [NAME] was shocked to find that there were two Fortune Seeds inside! By the looks of those at the Skydome Palace, it would seem that they had no clue as to how useful this item is.
[NAME]虽然对此略感奇怪，但也没有多说，参与完归位大典便回归了宗门。	Although [NAME] found it a bit odd, but there was nothing more to be said, and so returned to the School after having finished returning the remains.
[NAME]刚准备加入寻找先天灵宝的队伍，却突然发现识海中竟然多出一封古朴的图卷，宝物有灵，竟然自茫茫人海中选择了[NAME]。	[NAME] was preparing to join those searching for Numinous Treasure when a tattered old scroll was discovered and, as it was possessing Qi, chose [NAME] from amongst the sea of people.
面对如此机缘，[NAME]狂喜之余却又感到一丝不安，不知这是福是祸……	Confronted with such luck, [NAME] was elated and yet felt a sense of unease at the same time as it was unclear as to whether this would lead to fortune or disaster…
[NAME]使了个法术，对蛟龙发起挑衅，成功吸引了蛟龙的注意。	[NAME] cast a spell that provoked Flood Dragon, drawing its attention.
见蛟龙被吸引，[NAME]驾起剑光，时不时的挑动蛟龙的怒火，向门派方向飞遁而去。	Seeing that Flood Dragon's attention had been drawn, [NAME] used a sword to reflect light from time to time to maintain the dragon's attention as they flew towards the Sect.
见蛟龙被吸引，[NAME]试图向门派逃遁。然而[NAME]御剑速度有限，竟然被蛟龙半路追上，一番缠斗下，[NAME]身负重伤。	Seeing that Flood Dragon's attention had been drawn, [NAME] tried to flee towards the Sect. Unfortunately, there was a limit to the speed of [NAME]'s artifact and so Flood Dragon was able to catch up halfway there and launch an attack in midair, severely injuring [NAME].

[NAME]施展法术，将此地混乱的阴阳之息牵引到自身之上。	[NAME] cast a spell drawing the Qi of the chaotic Yin Yang in this place into their body.
受到气息牵引，这团阴阳之息迅速凝聚，其中一股晦涩的气息渐渐显化出来。[NAME]赶忙驾驭法宝，向门派方向飞遁而去。	Having drawn the Qi in, it quickly condensed and an vague and confusing Qi began to coalesce. [NAME] hurriedly reined in the Artifact and flew off towards the Sect.
受到气息牵引，这团阴阳之息迅速凝聚，其中一股晦涩的气息渐渐显化出来。[NAME]赶忙驾驭法宝，向门派方向飞遁而去。可惜[NAME]御剑速度有限，在赶回门派的途中，这团阴阳之息就完全凝聚，显化出烛龙之形。[NAME]全力逃窜，然而以个人之力，完全无法对抗阴阳之道显化的烛龙之体，最终身受重伤。	Having drawn the Qi in, it quickly condensed and an vague and confusing Qi began to coalesce. [NAME] hurriedly reined in the Artifact and flew off towards the Sect. Unfortunately the speed of [NAME]'s artifact had its limits and on the way back to the Sect, this Yin Yang Qi finished condensing and transformed into an Torch Dragon. [NAME] scrambled to get away, but was unable to resist the Torch Dragon coalesced by the Rule of Yin and Yang and so suffered great injury.
[NAME]想了想，还是决定离开。	[NAME] thought it over and decided to leave.
[NAME]一番打听之下，原来是一位古修刚刚从此地复苏。不过这名古修已然离开了。[NAME]将这名古修的信息记下，便离开了此地。	[NAME] launched an inquiry and discovered that there was an ancient cultivator here that had just been revived. Unfortunately this ancient cultivator had already left. [NAME] took down the ancient cultivator's information and was forced to depart.

[NAME]连忙在龙崖石刻下盘膝而坐，静心参悟。随着无数玄妙的字符流转，一篇古朴艰深的功法已经印入[NAME]脑海。就在[NAME]准备继续感悟时，却见天边涌来一股妖云，转眼便笼罩龙崖石刻方圆数里。转眼妖云散去，现出数十个形态各异的大妖，一身蛮荒凶戾之气息翻滚，竟然是传承自上古的炼体者。	[NAME] quickly sat on knees at the bottom of the Dragon Cliff inscriptions and started meditating on it. As the countless profound texts circulating in mind, a classic and abstruse Law had been ingrained into [NAME]'s brain. Just as [NAME] prepared to meditated further, a series of demonic cloud appeared from the edge of sky, which approached and shrouded the area near Dragon Cliff inscriptions in no time. In a twinkling of an eye, the cloud vanished and dozens of big Yaoguai of various forms manifested themselves. Savage and fierce, they turned out to be Physical cultivators of an ancient legacy.
就在众人惊疑不定时，为首一名大妖大喝：“龙崖石刻乃妖族圣地，如今圣地再开，我万妖殿自封千载，也当重新出世，吾奉命特来收回圣地，各位请回罢。”此言一出，众人哗然，那为首的大妖却视若无睹，张口发出阵阵妖光，竟然将龙崖石刻拔地吞入腹中，绝尘而去。	Just as people got confused, one leading Yaoguai shouted,"The Dragon Cliff inscriptions is the holy site of for us Yaoguai. Now that the site is opened again, the Daemonia Temple that concealed itself for a thousand years shall reemerge in the world as well. Now I have been ordered to take back the holy site, please go back to where you came from." As soon as this was announced, the people listening were in uproar. But the leading Yaoguai ignored them, while opened its mouth and shot out bursts of demonic light, magically swallowing the Dragon Cliff inscriptions into belly before it swiftly left.
由于万妖殿千年隐世，众人不知底细，也无人轻举妄动，然而这一惊天消息却快速传遍修行界。	Due to the Daemonia Temple being hidden for a thousand years, no one had exact knowledge about them and were unsure what to do about it. However, this shocking news quickly spread throughout the cultivation world.

听说老王家邻居又添了个新丁，羡慕死了！	I hear the neighbors have a new kid, I'm so jealous!
最近我们村的有的年轻人也着了魔怔，天天堵在村口，闹什么罢工，还动手打捕快。真是造孽。	Some youngsters in our village have been acting odd lately, blocking the entrance to the village and getting up to no good. How scandalous.
没有什么新鲜事啊，一切都平淡无奇！好想也能有仙缘降临在我身上啊。可是我从来都没见过仙人，真让人沮丧……	Everything is so dull, there's never anything new! I want to get to know Immortals and become their disciple, too. I've never even seen an Immortal though…
前几天遇到个配钥匙的，说的话可真让人生气。	A few days ago, I met a locksmith, but everything that one said pissed me off.
最近村里的吃的老是不见，奇怪。	There's never anything to eat around the village recently, it's odd.

天下诸多削铁如泥之利器，却少闻削泥如铁之钝器。利器专于采粗琢坚，钝器专于集脆建筑，各有所用也。吾辈所用皆为利器，闻世上稀有采玉之钝器，但不知何处可循。	There are so many well known great sharp tools that exist, though you never hear about the blunt ones. Sharp and blunt tools have different uses though, so… We all use sharp ones, but there are said to be some blunt ones used in mining jade, thought I know not where they might be.
之前看到个卖艺的，他带着各种野兽，那些野兽还会自己排阵排列。有一次他来，被一个穿兽皮的人叫住了说了几句，所有野兽都被那穿兽皮的收走，卖艺的也跟他走了，后来就再也没来过了。	I saw an entertainer before that had all types of beasts with him. They lined themselves up by themselves. He came once, and a man dressed in beast hides stopped him, spoke to him briefly, then the beasts and the entertainer left with him. He never returned.

神木林中有些奇怪的蘑菇，吃了之后看见有好多精灵在帮我切石，好快乐啊！	There are some odd mushrooms in the Mistwood Forest. After eating them, I saw many elves at work cutting stone, it was fantastic!
我以前去过大漠做生意，有个村子里的人啊，只吃生肉啊……面粉他们根本不会吃也不会做！	I've been to the Great Desert before for business. There's a village there where the people only eat raw meat… They don't know a thing about Flour!
前几天村里有个人吃了外地买来的蘑菇，昏睡三天，睡觉的时候时而大汗不止，时而哈哈大笑。结果醒来之后跟我们说他在梦中看见整个村子的人都变成了鸟，我们都觉得他疯了，但他后来也挺正常的。	Someone in the village ate some mushrooms brought from outside the village a few days ago…he was out for 3 days. While out, he was sweating profusely or giggling in his sleep. When he awoke, he told us he had seen everyone in town turn into birds in a dream. We thought he went crazy, but he returned to normal later on.
有一天有个外地人卖蘑菇，很便宜，我买了点回家吃了之后，感觉墙上都是花朵，我就一直采一直采……不知多少天之后，发现大家都用异样的眼神看着我，原来我一直在墙边挖土……	I once bought some mushrooms for very cheap, which I ate when I got back home. I soon realized that there were flowers on the wall, which I began to pick. I don't know how many days later, I realized that people were looking at me in a funny manner, it seems I had been digging at the wall...
江岸沃野面粉产量奇高，我们祖上小麦产量不弱于他们，可面粉产量却不及其半也不知为何。	Riverbank Plains produces quite a bit of Flour. Our ancestors produces more Wheat than them, though we were never able to produce half as much Flour and it's not known why.

太阳底下哪有什么新鲜事……无非是柴米油盐酱醋茶罢了	What new things are there in the world… It's all just rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, tea, and firewood.
说来令人生气，那日我与人斗法，才使出半招，就被人说偷学那西域的绝学。真的气煞我也……须知天下剑术起手无非就是那几种定式……不分辨清楚后续变化，又怎能武断下此结论？	It's upsetting, but that day, I fought and only used half of what I know, yet I was accused of stealing secret techniques from the west. I'm really quite upset… Swordsmanship is nothing more than those patterns… You don't distinguish between the changes that follow, how can you come to any real conclusion?
近日师弟总是催我快快突破境界，但突破境界兹事体大，怎能草率？我也只能说一句快了快了，真是苦恼。	Recently, the others urge me to hurry up and break through to a new State. How can you hurry such a thing? I can only tell them I'm almost there… How vexing.
近日吾突然有所悟：修行之道，与他人而说，无论好坏毁誉，既不能掌握，亦皆为外物。道之所在，终尽归于自身。能无愧于心，便足矣。	I've come to a realization recently: The Creed of Practice, it's not good or bad, it's just something that can't be mastered completely. The Creed, in the end, lies within. To be worthy of one's own heart is enough.
没有……	No…

为了突破境界，修行者耗尽心力搭建超越极限的聚灵阵。\n然而不知为何，聚灵阵的效果竟然被放大了千百倍。\n在成阵的瞬间，修行者瞬间被无尽的灵气奴役化为傀儡……\n四周大地撕裂，万物凋零……	To break through states, a cultivator exerted all efforts to build this Qi condensing formation to go beyond limits.\nBut for some reason, the formation's effect was amplified by a thousand times.\nThe cultivator was made a vessel by countless Qi the moment when the formation took shape.\nGrounds were torn apart as all things started to wither.

乱界夹缝-空之界	Rift in the Chaos: Realm of Void

Only barely exists on the Inspired Pond of Destiny.\nThis realm is now filled with evil spirits that died when heaven and earth fell apart. They live in this chaotic realm, invincible to the five elements.
沉默的守誓人	Silent Keeper
口乃心之门户,口闭心沉。\n此处一静,万物皆景。\n此口一闭,万籁皆胜。\n此心一沉,万象可爱。	Silence is the cure to a confused mind.\nQuiet, and all things are beautiful.\nSilence, and all creatures are greater.\nCompose, and all lives are lovable.
磁龟	Magnet Turtle
“让战争停止吧！”。人们这样哀求着。\n“销毁这些杀人的兵器吧！”。人民这样祈祷着。\n大地回应了这呼唤，祂自天坑中爬出。\n在那瞬间，刀兵禁止。	“Please, make the war stop!” So pleaded the people.\n“Please, destroy these killer weapons!” So prayed the people.\nThe earth responded to the call, and thus the turtle came crawling out of the crater.\nSo it forbids all weapons.
末法的代言人	Advocate of Apocalypse
修行真的可以获得永恒么？\n那这片天地，又为何衰败至此？\n谎言！都是谎言！\n该死的仙神，该死的修行！！	Can cultivation really grant immortality?\nThen why is this world still decaying?\nEverything is just a lie!\nDamn cultivation and immortality!
我即为阵	Formation of One
门派阵法试炼，年少的修行者遭受同门排挤，被驱赶下山。\n百年之后，“魔傀”横空出世，以一人成阵的秘法横扫天下。	A young cultivator was excluded by fellow disciples during the trial run of their sect formation.\nOne hundred years later, Demon Vessel, a formation of one person, appeared out of nowhere to defeat all creatures in its path.

枯荣	Wither and Flourish
身似枯木不自在，心如野草遍地青。	A withered body cannot contain an ever-growing soul.
海之子	Son of the Sea
曾经的我瘦小而懦弱。\n但是当我看到大海的那一刻，我明白了我的来处。\n来吧！潮汐之力，你等皆当归于潮汐!\n而潮汐，尽归我身！	I used to be weak and timid.\nBut the moment I saw the ocean, I realized where I came from.\nCome, the power of tide! You will all be swallowed up into the water!\nAnd tides will all return to me!
烬灭的轻语	Whisper of Destruction
咕咕~~咕咕~~\n神鸟快乐的鸣叫着———\n如珠玉落盘，轻语低吟。\n我知道，这是万物烬灭的声音……	*chirp*\nDivine bird are chirping to their hearts' content.\nGentle whispers like raindrops falling on the windowpane.\nI know, this is the sound of all things' destruction.
残渣	Fragmented Remains
天地开辟以降，悄然湮灭者众，留名青史者寡。\n被尽数遗忘后的残留下些许顽固的执念，随意的聚合。\n化作茫然的无名者徘徊在历史的缝隙。\n化作残渣。	Ever since the beginning of time, most people have lived and died without leaving any legacy behind.\nObsession remained after these forgotten pasts, slowly amassing strengths.\nNameless souls lingered on the edge of history.\nLeaving only remains.
